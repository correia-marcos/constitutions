National Unity and Reconciliation This Constitution provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society characterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and a future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful co-existence and development opportunities for all South Africans, irrespective of colour. race, class, belief or sex. The pursuit of national unity, the well-being of all South African citizens and peace require reconciliation between the people of South Africa and the reconstruction of society. The adoption of this Constitution lays the secure foundation for the people of South Africa to transcend the divisions and strife of the past, which generated gross violations of human rights, the transgression of humanitarian principles in violent conflicts and a legacy of hatred, fear, guilt and revenge. These can now be addressed on the basis that there is a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not for victimisation. In order to advance such reconciliation and reconstruction, amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts, omissions and offences associated with political objectives and committed in the course of the conflicts of the past. To this end. Parliament under this Constitution shall adopt a law determining a firm cut-off date, which shall be a date after 8 October 1990 and before 6 December 1993, and

providing for the mechanisms, criteria and procedures, including tribunals, if any, through which such amnesty shall be dealt with at any time after the law has been passed. With this Constitution and these commitments we, the people of South Africa. open a new chapter in the history of our country. Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika.

The Constitution of South Africa shall provide for the establishment of one sovereign state, a common South African citizenship and a democratic system of government committed to achieving equality between men and women and people of all races. II Everyone shall enjoy all universally accepted fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties. which shall be provided for and protected by entrenched and justiciable provisions in the Constitution. which shall be drafted after having given due consideration to inter alia the fundamental rights contained in Chapter 3 of this Constitution. III The Constitution shall prohibit racial, gender and all other forms of discrimination and shall promote racial and gender equality and national unity. Iv The Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land. It shall be binding on all organs of state at all levels of government. V The legal system shall ensure the equality of all before the law and an equitable legal process. Equality before the law includes laws, programmes or activities that have as their object the amelioration of the conditions of the disadvantaged, including those disadvantaged on the grounds of race, colour or gender. VI There shall be a separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary, with appropriate checks and balances to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness. VII The judiciary shall be appropriately qualified. independent and impartial and shall have the power and jurisdiction to safeguard and enforce the Constitution and all fundamental rights. VIII There shall be representative government embracing multi-party democracy, regular elections. universal adult suffrage, a common voters' roll, and, in general, proportional representation. IX Provision shall be made for freedom of information so that there can be open and accountable administration at all levels of government. X Formal legislative procedures shall be adhered to by legislative organs at all levels of government. XI The diversity of language and culture shall be acknowledged and protected, and conditions for their promotion shall be encouraged.

XIV Provision shall be made for participation of minority political parties in the legislative process in a manner consistent with democracy. XV Amendments to the Constitution shall require special procedures involving special majorities. XVI Government shall be structured at national, provincial and local levels. XVII At each level of government there shall be democratic representation. This principle shall not derogate from the provisions of Principle XIII.

XVIII
The powers, boundaries and functions of the national government and provincial governments shall be defined in the Constitution. Amendments to the Constitution which alter the powers, boundaries, functions or institutions of provinces shall in addition to any other procedures specified in the Constitution for constitutional amendments, require the approval of a special majority of the legislatures of the provinces, alternatively, if there is such a chamber, a two-thirds majority of a chamber of Parliament composed of provincial representatives, and if the amendment concerns specific provinces only, the approval of the legislatures of such provinces will also be needed. Provision shall be made for obtaining the views of a provincial legislature concerning all constitutional amendments regarding its powers, boundaries and functions. XIX The powers and functions at the national and provincial levels of government shall include exclusive and concurrent powers as well as the power to perform functions for other levels of government on an agency or delegation basis. XX Each level of government shall have appropriate and adequate legislative and executive powers and functions that will enable each level to function effectively.

The level at which decisions can be taken most effectively in respect of the quality and rendering of services, shall be the level responsible and accountable for the quality and the rendering of the services. and such level shall accordingly be empowered by the Constitution to do so. 2.

maintenance of national security or the prevention of unreasonable action taken by one province which is prejudicial to the interests of another province or the country as a whole, the Constitution shall empower the national government to intervene through legislation or such other steps as may be defined in the Constitution. 3. Where there is necessity for South Africa to speak with one voice, or to act as a single entityâ€”in particular in relation to other statesâ€”powers should be allocated to the national government. 4. Where uniformity across the nation is required for a particular function, the legislative power over that function should be allocated predominantly, if not wholly, to the national government. S. The determination of national economic policies, and the power to promote interprovincial commerce and to protect the common market in respect of the mobility of goods, services, capital and labour, should be allocated to the national government. 6. Provincial governments shall have powers, either exclusively or concurrently with the national government, inter alma for the purposes of provincial planning and development and the rendering of services: and (b) in respect of aspects of government dealing with specific socio-economic and cultural needs and the general well-being of the inhabitants of the province. 7. Where mutual co-operation is essential or desirable or where it is required to guarantee equality of opportunity or access to a government service, the powers should be allocated concurrently to the national government and the provincial governments. 8. The Constitution shall specify how powers which are not specifically allocated in the Constitution to the national government or to a provincial government, shall be dealt with as necessary ancillary powers pertaining to the powers and functions allocated either to the national government or provincial governments.

The national government shall not exercise its powers (exclusive or concurrent) so as to encroach upon the geographical, functional or institutional integrity of the provinces.

XXIII
In the event of a dispute concerning the legislative powers allocated by the Constitution concurrently to the national government and provincial governments which cannot be resolved by a court on a construction of the Constitution. precedence shall be given to the legislative powers of the national government.

government. XXVI
