AND WHEREAS they, affirm and respect that Christianity has played and continues to play a prominent role in the lives of the indigenous Fijians and the enduring contribution it has had, but also accepting the rights of other religious groups to practise their own religion; AND WHEREAS they re-affirm that the indigenous people of Fiji are endowed with their lands and other resources and the right to govern themselves for their advancement and welfare; AND WHEREAS they re-assert their recognition that all peoples of Fiji in respecting the rights of others to live in harmony are entitled to due deference to their customs and traditional way of life; AND WHEREAS they reiterate their recognition that people and institutions remain free only when and for so long as freedom is founded upon respect for the spiritual and moral values of each other and a mutual observance of the rule of law; NOW THEREFORE to achieve those ends the following provisions shall take effect as the Constitution of Fiji:-
