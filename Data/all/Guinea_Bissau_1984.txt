CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU

PREFACE

The glorious political armed fight for the national liberation, victoriously organized and directed by the African Party for the Independence of the Guinea and Cabo Verde (PAIGC) will be inscribed in History as one of the most beautiful pages of the african people resistance against the foreign domination. The PAIGC, discharging the most roughs knockdowns against the portuguese colonialism, in the political and military action plan, has affirmed itself as one of the most efficient fighting instruments ever created in Africa for her complete liberation. Expressing in common action the most profound and authentic aspirations of the popular masses, the PAIGC has never interpreted the historical mission he was given , as aiming only the colonial system abolition. Thus, at the same time his heroical warriors were going on destroying the colonial State apparatus in Guinea, through the destruction of the military and economical forces on which it relyed, the PAIGC spread the basis of the future independent State, through a patient activity in the ideological, political, and social-economical areas. This action, developed during 18 years of fight, eleven of which holding weapons, finds its theoretical fundamentation in the genial thought of AMILCAR CABRAL. And, as a result of his clear vision and of a scientific interpretation of our time and of the geopolitical space realities, in which we live in, Cabral led to the Party guidings and action methods clearlydefined and able to carry him to realize the model of society at which our people aspires, one society without expliotation of man from man, definitely free from misery, ignorance, fear and decease. The independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, proclaimed in September, the 24th 1973, marks the begining of a new stage in the life of our people. A stage when, after we have declared ourselves as sovereigns before the international community, prioritarial tasks are imposed to us, which performance conditionates the materialization of the aims inscribed in the Major Programm of our Party- The National Unity and Development. Unity and Development that are indispensable to the defense and maintaining of the conquests we have achieved with the supreme sacrifice of the Nationality Founder AMILCAR CABRAL, and of so many other heroes and martyrs of our liberation glorious armed fight.

Adopting the present Constitution, which follows faithfully the line of an institutional evolution that has always followed our ideals and options, a line reaffirmed by the fair and revitalizing action of the Reajusting Movement of November the 14th, by the legality, rights and return to the use of the fundamental liberties, the Popular National Assembly of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau reveals the fact that its articulate is imbued with the humanism that has always inspired the PAIGC and that is reflected in the rights and liberties guaranteed here to the citizens, as a reverseless conquest of our fight. The Popular Nacional Assembly congratulates itself also for the circumstance that the present constitutional text is a result of a wide national debate in which the popular masses decisively participated.

Therefore, acting as a faithful interprets of the people's will and in the exercise of its responsabilities as the soveranity top organ, the Popular National Assembly approves and adopts, as fundamental Law and to be in force since May the 16th 1984, the presents Consitution of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.
