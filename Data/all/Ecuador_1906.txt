Chambers is sent to the executive power for his sanction.

If, however, the revising Chamber, by a majority of its members, also objects to the observations, the Bill will be returned to the Chamber of origin, which will then pass it on to the executive power for his sanction, which cannot be refused. G4. If the executive power should not return a measure, sanctioned or with observations, within six days, or three in case of urgency, or if he should refuse to sanction it after all constitutional requirements have been complied with, it shall have the force of law.
