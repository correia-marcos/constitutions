CONSTITUTION OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND

SOMDET PHRAPARAMINTHARAMAHA BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ SAYAMMINTHARATHIRAT BOROMMANATTHABOPHIT Enacted on the 22nd day of October B.E. 2519; Being the 31st Year of the Present Reign. Phrabat Somdet Phraparamintharamaha Bhumibol Adulyadej Mahittalathibet Ramathibodi Chakkri Narubodin Sayamminthrarathirat Borommanatthabophit is graciously pleased to proclaim that: The Chairman of the National Administrative Reform Council has advised His Majesty the King that, as a group of persons had committed subversive acts against the security of the Kingdom, the Throne, and the national economy, and, finally, there had been great riots in the country on 6th October B.E. 2519 which would eventually cause calamity and destruction to the country, the National Administrative Reform Council, therefore, successfully seized the power and repealed the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand at 6.00 p.m. on 6th October B.E. 2519, and that as all the people have expressly and confidently showed the desire to have the democratic form of government with the King as Head, as being the sound and proper form of government for Thailand for the purpose of bringing about the security of the country and the happiness of all, but during the last forty years or so the administration under this form of government had not yet reached its goal in accordance with the desire of the people, for there existed no structure from which this form of government could be gradually and properly developed and, in particular, there existed obstacles to the proper observance of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand B.E. 2517, whilst the persons elected to participate in the national administration did not, in various ways, respect the spirit of the said Constitution, caring more for their personal interests than for the common interests of the country, thus causing the democratic form of government repeated failures

-2and bringing the country to an imminent catastrophe, it is, therefore, imperative to restore the democratic form of government by means of an appropriate national administrative reform which provides for gradual development. The first four years is the period for the restoration of the stability of the country, both economically and politically. During this period, the people should be allowed to participate in the national administration through the National Administrative Reform Assembly with appointed members controlling the national administration and, at the same time, the people should be encouraged to be interested in and to be aware of their duties. The second four years is the period when the people should be allowed greater participation in the national administration through the establishment of the National Assembly consisting of the House of Representatives with elected members and the Senate with appointed members. Both houses would equally share the powers and duties in the control of the national administration. In the third four year period, the powers of the House of Representatives should be increased and those of the Senate reduced to a practical degree. Thereafter, if the people should be well aware of the duties and responsibilities they owe the country under the democratic form of government, then the Senate could be abolished, leaving only the House of Representatives. In whichever direction the reform of the structure of this form of government is to proceed depends mainly on the justification of the conditions of each of the periods, and the Constitution has to be amended accordingly in order that the reform of the democratic form of government with the King as Head may be achieved in accordance with the objectives of this Constitution, which are the national security and the happiness of the people, while the main national institutions, which are the Nation, the Religion, and the King are upheld. In order to proceed gradually and in accordance
