Boundaries that are not yet determined shall be fixed by treaty and law. Art. 6. Sovereignty and the territory are indivisible and inalienable. Nevertheless, treaties may be concluded that tend toward union with one or several republics of Central America, or that have for their object the construction, improvement, operation and defense of an interoceanic canal through the national territory.

In any case, such use is restricted to the time absolutely necessary. Art. 7. Spanish is the official language of the State. Art. 8. The State has no official religion. Art. 9.

Such persons are Nicaraguan even for the purposes for which the Constitution or the laws require birth in national territory. (3) Infants of unknown parentage found in Nicaragua; (4) Natives of the other Republics of Central America, resident in Nicaragua, who personally declare to a competent authority their desire to be Nicaraguans, provided reciprocity exists in their country of origin and to the extent of such reciprocity.

Naturalized citizens lose their Nicaraguan nationality, and cannot recover it, when they propagate political doctrines that deny the concept of Patria, affect national sovereignty or tend to destroy the republican form of the Government. Art. 22. The law shall regulate matters pertaining to naturalization and to the manner of acquiring, losing and recovering it. Art. 23.

In the Chamber of Deputies twenty-eight Representatives shall belong to the majority party and fourteen to the minority; in the Senate twelve Senators shall belong to the majority and four to the minority. With respect to the Senate, the law may change the ratio of the minority in order that this shall always be, as nearly as possible, one third of the total membership. The Senate shall consist of the sixteen Senators elected directly by the people and the presidential candidate of the political party that attained second place in the popular vote. The ex-Presidents of the Republic who held office by direct popular vote shall also be members of the Senate as Life Senators. Art. 128. By its own right Congress shall meet regularly in the capital of the Republic on April 15 each year, and shall hold sixty sessions. This number of sessions may be prolonged by thirty more by resolution of both Chambers enacted mote proprio or at the request of the Executive Power. Art. 129. By convocation by the Executive Power and on the date indicated by him, the Congress shall meet in extraordinary sessions to deal solely with matters that the Executive Power submits to it, and shall close on the day indicated by him.

Art. 130. If for any reason Congress is unable to meet on the dates indicated, it shall do so as soon as possible. Art. 131.

The President of the Republic in person or represented by the Minister of Government shall attend the opening of the regular sessions of Congress in United Chambers and shall present a Message concerning the acts of his administration. This formality is not essential for Congress to exercise its functions legitimately. Art. 133. The quorum for each Chamber to hold its meetings shall be the absolute majority of its full membership, and for Congress in United
