The territory of the Republic is divided into provinces and these latter into municipal districts. The present provinces shall be named: Pinar del Rio, La Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camagiiey and Oriente. Art. 5. The flag of the Republic is that of Narciso L6pez, which was raised on Morro Fort at Havana on May 20, 1902, when the public powers were transmitted to the people of Cuba.

The Republic shall not recognize or consecrate, as having a national character, any flag, anthem, or coat of arms other than those to which this Article refers. On buildings, forts, and public dependencies, and at official acts, no flag shall be raised other than the national one, except foreign flags in those cases and in the manner permitted by protocol and by international usages, treaties, and the laws. As an exception, the flag of Carlos Manuel de C6spedes may be raised in the City of Bayamo, which is declared a national monument. The national anthem is the Hymn of Bayamo composed by Pedro Figueredo, and it shall be the only one played in all government dependenI In force October 10, 1940.

TITLE FOURTH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

Section First Individual Rights Art. 20. All Cubans are equal before the law. The Republic recognizes neither personal exemptions nor privileges. All discrimination by reason of sex, race, color, class, or any other that detracts from human dignity, is declared unlawful and punishable. The sanctions incurred by those who violate this precept shall be established by law. Art. 21. Penal laws shall have retroactive effect when they are favorable to the delinquent. There are excluded from this benefit, in cases where fraud was involved, public officers or employees who commit a crime in the exercise of their office, and those responsible for electoral crimes and crimes against the individual rights guaranteed by this Constitution. Those who commit these crimes shall have applied to them the penalties and qualifications according to the law in force at the time the crime is committed. Art. 22. No other laws shall have retroactive effect, unless the law itself so determines for reasons of public order, of social utility, or national necessity, expressly specified in the law, which must have a favorable vote of two-thirds of the total number of members of each co-legislative body. If the grounds for retroactivity are impugned in unconstitutionality proceedings, it shall be the court of constitutional and social guarantees that shall decide thereon, and it cannot, for technical reasons or any other motive whatever, refrain from doing so. In every case the law itself must establish the degree, manner, and form in which indemnity will be paid for the damages, if any, which the retroactivity causes to rights legitimately acquired in accordance with prior legislation. A law approved in accordance with this Article shall not be valid if it produces effects contrary to the provisions of Article 24 of this Constitution. Art. 23. Obligations of a civil character arising from contracts or from other acts or omissions producing them cannot be annulled or altered by either the legislative or the executive branch, and laws can consequently not have retroactive effect with respect to the said obligations. The. exercise of the rights of action derived from them can be suspended in a. case of serious national crisis, for such time as is reasonably necessary,,

No one can be deprived of his property except by competent judicial authority and for a justified cause of public utility or social interest, and always after payment of the corresponding indemnity in cash, judicially fixed. Non-compliance with these requisites shall determine the right of the person whose property has been expropriated, to be protected by the courts, and, if the case calls for it, to have his property restored to him. The reality of the cause of public utility or social interest, and the need for the expropriation, shall be decided by the courts in case of impugnation. Art. 25. The death penalty cannot be imposed. Exception is made as to members of the Armed Forces, for crimes of a military character, and as to persons guilty of treason, or of espionage in favor of the enemy at a time of war with a foreign nation. Art. 26. The law of criminal procedure shall establish the guarantees that are necessary in order that every crime may be proved independently of the testimony of the accused, the spouse, and also the relatives thereof to the fourth degree of consanguinity and second degree of affinity. The accused shall be considered innocent until a condemnatory sentence is issued against him. In all cases, the authorities and their agents shall make a record of the arrest, which shall be signed by the person arrested, who shall be informed, by the authority who ordered it, of the reason for it and the place to which he is going to be taken, all of these details being entered on the record. Registers of arrested persons and prisoners are public. Every act against the personal integrity, safety, or honor of an arrested person shall be imputable to those who apprehend or guard him, in the absence of proof to the contrary. A subordinate can refuse to comply with orders which violate this guarantee. A guard who uses arms against an arrested person or a prisoner who attempts flight shall be necessarily blamed and responsible, according to law, for the crime that he commits. Persons arrested or imprisoned for political or social reasons shall be confined in separate quarters from common criminals and shall not be required to do any labor whatever or subjected to the prison regulations for common prisoners. No arrested person or prisoner shall be kept isolated. Violations of this precept shall be tried by only the regular courts, whatever the place, the circumstances, and the persons participating in the arrest. Art. 27. Every arrested person shall be placed at liberty, or delivered to the competent judicial authority, within twenty-four hours following his arrest. Every arrest shall be set aside or shall be converted into imprisonment, by a judicial decision stating the reasons for it, within seventy-two hours after the arrested person is placed at the disposition of the competent judge. The interested person shall within the same period be notified of the decision rendered. Persons imprisoned but not yet convicted shall be kept in places distinct and completely separate from those utilized for serving sen-

tences, and those so imprisoned cannot be compelled to do any work whatever or be subjected to the prison regulations for those serving sentences. Art. 28. No one shall be indicted or condemned except by a competent judge or court, by virtue of laws antedating the crime and with the formalities and guarantees established by them. No sentence shall be pronounced against an indicted person in default nor shall anyone be condemned in a criminal cause without being heard. Neither shall anyone be compelled to testify against himself, or against his or her spouse or relatives within the fourth degree of consanguinity or second degree of affinity. No violence or coercion of any kind shall be exercised on" persons to compel them to testify. All testimony obtained in violation of this precept shall be null, and those responsible shall be subject to the penalties fixed by law. Art. 29. Everyone who is arrested or imprisoned outside of the cases or without the formalities and guarantees specified by the Constitution and the law shall be placed at liberty, on his own request or that of any other person, without the necessity of a power of attorney or the services of a lawyer, by means of summary habeas corpus proceedings before the regular courts. The court cannot decline its jurisdiction, or consider questions of competency in any case or for any reason, or defer its decision, which shall have preference over any other matter. Presentation, before the court which issued the writ of habeas corpus, of every arrested or imprisoned person, regardless of the authority or officer, person, or entity holding him, is absolutely obligatory, and no allegation of due obedience can be made. All provisions that impede or retard the presentation of the person deprived of liberty, as well as those causing any delay in the habeas corpus proceedings, shall be null, and the judicial authority shall so declare on its own initiative. When the arrested or imprisoned person is not presented before the court hearing the habeas corpus proceedings, that court shall order the arrest of the violator, who shall be judged as provided by law. Judges or justices who refuse to admit an application for a writ of habeas corpus, or who do not comply with the other provisions of this Article, shall be removed from their respective offices by the government section of the Supreme Court. Art. 30. Any person can enter and remain in the national territory, leave it, remove from one place to another, and change his residence, without necessity for a letter of safe-conduct, passport, or other similar requisite, except what is provided by the immigration laws and the powers of the authorities in case of criminal liability. No one shall be compelled to change his domicile or residence, except by mandate of a judicial authority and in the cases and with the requisites specified by law. No Cuban can be expatriated nor shall his entry into the territory of the Republic be prohibited. Art. 31. The Republic of Cuba offers and recognizes the right of asylum for political refugees, provided that those who avail themselves of it respect the national sovereignty and laws.

Art. 32. Secrecy of mail and other private documents is inviolable, and neither the former nor the latter can be seized or examined except by official agents or officers, by virtue of a decree, stating its reasons, issued by a competent judge.

Secrecy of telegraphic, telephonic, and cablegraphic communication is declared inviolable on the same terms. Art. 33. Every person can, without subjection to prior censorship, freely express his thoughts orally, in writing, or by any other graphic or oral means of expression, utilizing for the purpose any or all of the available means of diffusion. Editions of books, booklets, phonograph records, films, newspapers, or publications of any kind can be seized only when they attack the honor of persons, the social order or the public peace, and as the result of a resolution, stating its reasons, issued by a competent judicial authority and without prejudice to the responsibilities resulting from the criminal act committed. In the cases to which this Article refers, there can be no seizure of or interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises, equipment, or instruments used by the organ of publicity in question, except for civil liability. Art. 34. Domiciles are inviolable, and consequently no one can enter at night the domicile of another without the consent of its occupant, unless it be to rescue the victims of a crime or disaster; nor by day, except in the cases and in the manner determined by law. In case of the suspension of this guarantee, it shall be an indispensable requisite, for entering a person's domicile, that it be done by the proper competent authority, under a written order or resolution, an authentic copy of which shall be left with the occupant, his relatives, or the nearest neighbor, according to circumstances. When the authorities delegate any of their agents for the purpose, the same procedure shall be followed. Art. 35. The profession of all religions, as well as the exercise of all cults, is unrestricted, without other limitation than respect for Christian morality and public order.

lawful purposes of life, in accordance with the corresponding legal norms, without other limitation than that indispensable to insure public order. The formation and existence of political organizations contrary to the r6gime of the democratic representative government of the Republic, or which attack the completeness of the national sovereignty, are unlawful. Art. 38. Every act which prohibits or limits the participation of citizens in the political life of the Nation is declared punishable. Art. 39. Only Cuban citizens can exercise public functions which involve jurisdiction. Art. 40. Legal or administrative provisions, or those of any other kind, which regulate the exercise of the rights which this Constitution guarantees, shall be null if they diminish, restrict, or impair them. Adequate resistance for the protection of the individual rights above guaranteed is legitimate. The right of action to prosecute infractions of this Title is public, without surety or formality of any kind, and by a simple denunciation. The enumeration of the rights guaranteed in this Title does not exclude the others that this Constitution establishes, or others of analogous nature or that are derived from the principle of the sovereignty of the people and from the republican form of government. Section Second Constitutional Guarantees Art. 41. The guarantees of the rights recognized in Articles 26, 27 28, 29, 30 (paragraphs first and second), 32, 33, 36, and 37 (paragraph first) of this Constitution can be suspended, in all or a part of the national territory, for a period not to exceed forty-five calendar days, when the safety of the Nation requires it, or in case of war or of invasion of the national territory, serious disturbance of order, or others which deeply disturb public tranquillity. Suspension of constitutional guarantees can be ordered only by means of a special law passed by Congress or by a decree of the chief executive; but in the latter case, Congress must be called in the same decree of suspension, to meet within a period of forty-eight hours, to the end that, sitting as a single body, it may ratify or not ratify the suspension by a rollcall majority vote. If Congress thus assembled votes against the suspension, the guarantees shall be automatically re-established. Art. 42. The territory in which the guarantees referred to in the preceding Article are suspended shall be governed by the public order law previously enacted; but neither the said law nor any other can direct the suspension of guarantees other than those mentioned. Neither can new crimes be declared or other penalties be imposed beyond those established by law when the suspension is ordered. Those arrested for the reasons which led to the suspension must be incarcerated in special places intended for persons indicted- or penalized for political or social crimes. The executive branch is prohibited from detaining any person whatever for more than ten days without delivering him to the judicial authorities.

TITLE FIFTH
THE FAMILY AND CULTURE

Art. 43. the Nation. Marriage shall be valid only when performed by officers with legal capacity to do so. Judicial matrimony is gratis and shall be maintained by law. Matrimony is the legal basis of the family and shall rest on an absolute equality of rights for both spouses; its economic regime shall be organized in accordance with this principle. A married woman has full civil capacity, and does not require permission or authorization from her husband to control her property, freely engage in commerce or industry, or exercise any profession, trade, or art, and to dispose of the proceeds of her labor. Marriage can be dissolved by agreement of the spouses or on petition of either of the two for the reasons and in the manner established by law. The courts shall determine those cases in which, for reasons of equity, a union between persons with legal capacity to marry shall, because of their stability and exceptional nature, be given the same status as civil marriage. Living allowances for the woman and the children shall enjoy preference over every other obligation, and. against that preference no plea can be made of exemption of property, salary, pension, or economic income of any kind. Unless the woman has proven means of subsistence, or is declared guilty, an allowance shall be fixed for her in proportion to the financial position of the husband, and also taking into account the needs of social life. This allowance shall be paid and guaranteed by the divorced husband and shall continue until his ex-spouse again marries, without detriment to the allowance that will be fixed for each child, which must also be guaranteed. Adequate penalties shall be imposed .by law on those who, in case of divorce, of separation, or for any other reason, seek to escape or elude that responsibility. Art. 44. Parents are obligated to support, aid, train, and educate their children, and the latter to respect and aid their parents. The law shall see to the fulfillment of these duties by adequate guarantees and sanctions. Children born out of wedlock to a person who at the time of conception was competent to marry have the same rights and duties as specified in the preceding paragraph, except as to what the law prescribes with respect to inheritance. To this end, the same rights shall pertain to those born out of wedlock to a married person, when such person acknowledges them, or the relationship is declared by a court decision. Investigation of paternity shall be regulated by law. All qualifications as to the nature of the relationship are abolished. No statement whatever shall be entered differentiating births, or as to the marital status of the parents, in the birth records, or in any certification, record of christening, or certificate referring to the relationship.

Section First The Family The family, maternity, and marriage have the protection of

53

Art. 45. The fiscal regime, insurance, and social aid shall be applied in accordance with the standards of protection for the family, established in this Constitution. Childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and moral and material abandonment. The Nation, provinces, and municipalities shall organize adequate institutions for the purpose. Art. 46. Subject to the restrictions specified in this Constitution, Cubans shall be at liberty to bequeath one-half of the estate. Section Second Culture Art. 47. Culture in all of its manifestations is a primordial interest of the Nation. Scientific investigation, artistic expression, and the publication of the results thereof are unrestricted; as is teaching, without prejudice, with respect to the last-named, to the inspection and regulation to which the Nation is entitled, and which is established by law. Art. 48. Primary instruction is obligatory for minors of school age, and it shall be furnished by the Nation, without prejudice to the co-operation entrusted to municipal initiative. Both this instruction and pre-primary and vocational instruction shall be gratis when given by the Nation, province, or municipality. The necessary school supplies shall also be gratis. Lower secondary instruction and all higher instruction furnished by the Nation or the municipalities shall be gratis, excluding specialized preuniversity and university study. At the institutes now created or which may be created in future, having a pre-university status, there can be maintained or established by law the payment of a modest matriculation fee by way of co-operation, which shall be devoted to the requirements of each establishment. As far as possible, the Republic shall offer scholarships for the enjoyment of official instruction that is not gratis to youths who, having shown outstanding vocation and aptitude, are prevented by insufficient resources from taking such studies at their own expense. Art. 49. The Nation shall maintain a system of schools for adults, devoted particularly to the elimination and prevention of illiteracy; predominantly practical rural schools, organized with a view to the interests of the small agricultural, maritime, or other communities, and schools of arts and trades and of agricultural, industrial, and commercial technique, so oriented that they will meet the needs of the national economy. All of this instruction shall be gratis, and the provinces and municipalities, to the extent of their abilities, shall collaborate in their maintenance. Art. 50. The Nation shall maintain the normal schools indispensable for the technical preparation of the teachers charged with the primary instruction in the public schools. No other institution can issue titles to primary teachers, with the exception of the schools of pedagogy of the universities. The foregoing provisions are no bar to the right of schools created by law to issue teaching titles in connection with the special matters which they teach. The teaching titles of special capacity shall carry the right to preferential appointment to positions that are vacant or are created in the respective schools and specialties.

Public officers, a demonstration of capacity and fulfillment of the other requisites and formalities established by law, are designated by competent authority to perform public functions or services, whether receiving or not receiving a salary or wage as a charge on the budgets of the Nation, a province, or a municipality, or from autonomous entities. Art. 106. Civil public officers, employees, and workers of all branches of the Nation, those of the provinces, the municipalities, and the autonomous entities, or corporations, are servants exclusively of the general interests of the Republic and their non-removability is guaranteed by this Constitution, with the exception of those who hold political offices and positions of confidence.

Those who have property of their own can receive only the part of the pension or retirement allowance that is necessary in order that, when added to their own income, it may not exceed the maximum pension that shall be fixed by law.

Persons now enjoying pensions or retirement allowances greater than $2,400 per annum shall not effectively receive a greater annual amount.

Art. 113. Monthly payment of retirement allowances and pensions for services rendered to the Nation, the provinces, and the municipalities, in the proportion permitted by the condition of the public treasury, which shall in no case be less than fifty per cent of the lawful basic amount, shall be an obligation of the Nation. The amounts for retirement allowances and pensions shall be included each year in the general budget of the Nation. No pension or retirement allowance shall be less than the minimum daily wage in force by virtue of what is established in Article 61 of the Constitution. Retirement allowances and pensions of officers and employees of the Nation, the provinces, and the municipalities, comprised in the general pension law in force, shall be paid at the same time that officers and employees in active service receive their pay, the Nation, provinces, and municipalities, as the case may be, being obligated to raise the necessary resources to meet this obligation. Payment of pensions to veterans of the War for Independence, and to their families, shall be considered preferential to every other obligation of the Nation. Art. 114. Entry into the notarial career and into the body of registrars of property shall in future be by competitive examination regulated by law. Art. 115. The accumulation and management of social retirement funds can be independent, in the manner determined by law; but within four sessions following the promulgation of this Constitution, Congress shall enact a law establishing the norms of a general character by which all existing retirement allowances and pensions, or any that are created in future, shall be governed, with reference to benefits, contributions, minimum requisites, and guarantees.

TITLE THIRTEENTH

Sole Section Relations between Congress and the Government Art. 164. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are responsible for their acts of government, before the House and the Senate. These bodies can grant confidence to or withhold it from the Prime Minister, a minister, or the cabinet as a whole, in the manner specified in this Constitution. Art. 165. Each co-legislative body can determine the total or partial removal of the cabinet, raising a question of confidence, which shall be presented by means of a motion, stating its grounds, in writing, and with the signature of at least one-third of its members. This motion shall be reported immediately to the other members of the respective body and shall be discussed and voted on one week after its presentation. If not resolved on within two weeks after said presentation, it shall be considered rejected. In order that these motions may be validly approved, an affirmative majority vote, always by roll call, of one more than half of the total membership of the House of Representatives or of the Senate, respectively, shall be necessary. The fact that a bill presented by the government or by a minister is voted down, or that a bill returned by the President of the Republic is passed over his veto, shall in no way compel the Prime Minister or the ministers to resign. If a question of confidence arises simultaneously in both co-legislative bodies, that raised in the House of Representatives shall have preference. Art. 166. There shall be total and partial crises. A total crisis shall be considered to be that raised with respect to the Prime Minister or that which refers to more than three ministers. The others shall be considered partial. Art. 167. The faculty of refusing confidence to the entire government, to the Prime Minister, or to any of the ministers forming part of the cabinet, can be exercised only after lapse of at least six months from the original appointment of the cabinet, or from the subsequent production of a total crisis by the approval of a motion of no confidence by the respective co-legislative body, according to the rules established in this Constitution. Ministers who have been named because of removal of their predecessors in a partial crisis can be subjected to a vote of no confidence only after six months from their designation, unless it is a case of a total crisis. When either of the co-legislative bodies has resolved favorably on a motion of no confidence, it cannot again raise one until a year has elapsed, during which the said faculty shall pertain to the other co-legislative body, which in any case cannot exercise it until at least six months have elapsed from the appointment of the cabinet or ministers to whom the said question refers.

HeinOnline -- English translation of the original Constitution of 1940. 556 1940

557

Two partial crises shall be equivalent to a total crisis, for the purpose of the six months' restriction to which this Article refers. In no case can questions of confidence be raised in the last six months of each presidential term. The cabinet can of itself raise a question of confidence with respect to the entirety of its members, or with respect to any of the ministers. In this case it shall be immediately discussed and resolved. The fact that a motion of confidence raised by the government has previously been decided, does not prevent or restrict Congress from freely exercising its right to raise questions of confidence. Art. 168. In any case in which confidence is refused to the government or to any of its members, the full government or the members thereof affected by the refusal of confidence shall resign within forty-eight hours following the parliamentary resolution, and if they do not do so they shall so be deemed to be removed, and the President of the Republic shall declare. The outgoing minister shall temporarily continue in charge following his resignation until delivery to his successor. Art. 169. A refusal of confidence to the full cabinet or to any of its members means only the non-conformity of the co-legislative body that raised the question with the policy of the minister or of the government as a whole. A refusal of confidence implies that in the cabinet that is formed or reorganized immediately after the crisis, the ministers whose policy was the subject of the refusal of confidence cannot be named for the same portfolios.

Judges and courts are obligated to settle conflicts between laws in force and the Constitution, adjusting themselves to the principle that the latter shall always prevail over the former. When a judge or court considers any law, decree-law, decree, or provision inapplicable, because he deems that it violates the Constitution, he shall suspend the proceedings and forward the matter to the court of constitutional and social guarantees, in order that it may declare or deny the constitutionality of the precept in question and return the matter to the one who forwarded it, so that he may continue the proceedings, issuing the safety measures that are pertinent. In administrative proceedings, an unconstitutionality appeal may be filed when contentious-administrative proceedings are resorted to. If this course is not authorized by law, the unconstitutionality appeal can be filed directly against the administrative resolution. Unconstitutionality appeals, in the cases enumerated in Articles 131, 174, 182, and 186 of this Constitution, shall be filed directly with the court of constitutional and social guarantees. In every unconstitutionality appeal, the courts shall always decide on the merit of the claim.

No law, decree-law, decree, regulation, order, provision, or measure that has been declared unconstitutional can be applied in any case or manner, under penalty of disqualification to hold public office. A decision declaring unconstitutional a legal precept or an administrative measure or resolution shall obligate the body, authority, or officer who issued the annulled provision to repeal it immediately. In every case the legislative or regulatory provision or administrative measure declared unconstitutional shall be considered null and without any value or effect from the date that the decision is made public in court. Art. 195. The Supreme Court and the court of constitutional and social guarantees are obligated to publish their decisions without delay in the corresponding official periodical. The budget of the judicial branch shall annually contain an allotment for the payment of these requirements.

The territory, the name of each municipality, and the seal of its government shall be determined by law. Art. 210. Municipalities can associate for intermunicipal purposes by resolution of their respective municipal councils or commissions. Municipalities can also incorporate one with another, or can divide in order to constitute other new ones, or alter their boundaries by popular initiative and with the approval of Congress, after hearing the opinion of the respective municipal councils or commissions. To resolve on the separation of part of a municipal district and its addition to another or other adjacent ones, it shall be necessary that this be requested by at least ten per cent of the residents of the portion of territory that it is sought to separate, and that, at a referendum election, sixty per cent of the voters of the said part express their conformity with the separation. If the result of the referendum is favorable to the application presented, the matter shall be referred to Congress for its definitive resolution. When the new territorial bounds are fixed, and the division of properties is made, the right of private ownership of the assignor municipality shall be respected as to any properties acquired or constructed by it on the portion separated, without prejudice to recognizing, in favor of the municipality receiving it, the proportional part to which it is entitled for whatever it contributed for the acquisition or construction of said properties. Whenever it is a case of the formation of a new municipality, it shall be the function of the tribunal of accounts to report as to its economic capacity for the maintenance of its own government. Art. 211. The municipal government is an entity with powers to satisfy the peculiar collective needs of the local society and it is also an auxiliary body of the central power which the Nation exercises throughout all of the national territory. Art. 212. A municipality is autonomous. The municipal government is vested with all of the powers necessary to resolve without restriction the affairs of the local society. The faculties which are not vested in the municipal government by this Constitution are reserved to the national government. The Nation can act for the municipality, when the latter's action is inadequate, in case of epidemic, serious public disturbance, or other motives of general interest, in the manner determined by law.

The provincial council and the governor owe respect to the tribunal of accounts of the Nation in accounting matters, and are obligated to furnish it all of the data and reports that it requests, especially those relative to the preparation and liquidation of the budgets.

Section First Property and Finances of the Nation Art. 251. In addition to the property of the public domain and its own property, the Nation is the owner of all property existing in the territory of the Republic which does not pertain to the provinces or the municipalities, or individually or collectively to private owners. Art. 252. Property owned by the Nation can be alienated or encumbered only under the following conditions: (a) That Congress so resolve by a special law, for a reason of social necessity or convenience; and always by a vote of two-thirds of each colegislative body.

Constitutionsof Nations

(b) That the sale be made in response to public bidding. In the case of a lease, the procedure shall be as directed by law. (c) That the proceeds be destined to create work, attend to services, or satisfy public needs. The alienation or encumbrance can, nevertheless, be resolved upon in a regular law and effected without the requisite of public bidding, when it is done to carry out a national economic plan approved in a special law. Art. 253. The Nation shall not contract loans except by virtue of a law approved by two-thirds of the total number of members of each colegislative body, in which at the same time the permanent revenues necessary for the payment of interest and amortization are voted. Art. 254. The Nation guarantees the public debt, and, in general, every operation which implies economic liability for the national treasury, provided it was contracted in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the law. Section Second The Budget Art. 255. All revenues and expenditures of the Nation, with the exception of those mentioned later, shall be provided for and fixed in annual budgets, and shall be in force only during the year for which they were approved. The monies, special funds, or private patrimonies of bodies authorized by the Constitution or by law, and devoted to social security, public works, development of agriculture, and regulation of industrial, stockraising, commercial, or professional activities, and in general to the development of the national wealth, are excepted from the provisions of the preceding paragraph. These funds or their taxes shall be delivered to the autonomous body and administered by it, in accordance with the law which created them, subject to audit by the tribunal of accounts. Expenses of the legislative and judicial branches, those of the tribunal of accounts, and those of the interest and amortizations of loans, and the revenues by which they are to be covered, shall be permanent in character and shall be included in the fixed budget that shall be effective until revised by special laws. Art. 256. For the purposes of protection of the general and national interests, in any line of production, as well as of the professions, obligatory associations of producers can be established by law, which shall determine the manner of constitution and functioning of the national bodies and of the regional ones that are necessary, so that at all times they shall be governed by a majority of their members, with full authority; likewise granting them the right to meet the needs of their organized action by dues that will be imposed by operation of the said law. The budgets of these bodies or co-operatives shall be audited by the tribunal of accounts. Art. 257. Congress cannot include in budget laws any provisions introducing changes of a legislative or administrative or other nature, nor can it reduce or suppress revenues of a permanent character without at the same time establishing others to take their place, unless the reduction or suppression is the result of a reduction of permanent expenses of like amount; nor can it allot to any of the services that are to be provided for

575

in the annual budget an amount greater than that indicated in the government's project. It can create new services or amplify existing ones through the medium of laws. Every law which creates expenses outside of the budget or which involves expenses of that kind in future, must establish, under penalty of nullity, the means of covering them by one of these methods: (a) Creation of new revenues; (b) Suppression of prior expenditures; (c) Definite verification of the surplus by the tribunal of accounts. Art. 258. The study and preparation of the annual budgets of the Nation are functions of the executive branch; their approval or modification being a function of Congress, within the limits established in the Constitution. In case of peremptory necessity, Congress can resolve on a special budget by means of a law. The executive branch shall submit the proposed annual budget to Congress, through the House of Representatives, sixty days prior to the date on which it is to become effective. The President of the Republic and particularly the minister of the treasury shall be subject to the liability determined by law if the budget reaches Congress after the date above fixed. The House of Representatives must forward the proposed budget to the Senate, with its resolution, thirty days prior to the date on which it is to become effective. If the general budget is not passed prior to the first day of the fiscal year in which it is to be effective, the one that has been in force shall be understood to be extended, together with the law of bases, by quarters. In this case, the executive branch can make no other modifications than those derived from expenses already paid, or services or expenses that are not necessary in the new fiscal period. The needs of the regular budget shall necessarily be covered by the regular revenues which it provides, and in no case can they be covered by special revenues, unless this is authorized by a special law. The regular budget shall become effective by the sole approval of Congress, which shall cause it to be published immediately. Art. 259. In the part relating to expenses, the budgets shall contain sections which shall specify: (a) The exact amount of the legitimate liabilities of the Nation liquidated but not paid, pertaining to previous budgets; (b) The proportion of that amount that will be paid from regular revenues of the new budget. The law of bases shall establish, with respect to the foregoing sections, the rules relative to the manner in which the amount or amounts fixed for payments during the life of the budget shall be prorated among creditors with liquidated claims. Art. 260. Allotments specified in the statement of expenses of the budget shall fix the maximum amounts destined to each service, which cannot be increased or transferred by the executive branch without prior authorization from Congress. The executive branch can, however, on its responsibility and when Congress is not in session, grant allotments or supplements of allotments in the following cases:

HeinOnline -- English translation of the original Constitution of 1940. 575 1940

576

Constitutions of Nations

(a) War or imminent danger of war; (b) Serious disturbance of the public order; (c) Public calamities. The handling of these allotments shall be determined by law. Art. 261. The executive branch is obligated to render the accounts of the Nation annually. For that purpose, the minister of the treasury shall liquidate the annual budget within three months following its expiration and, after approval by the cabinet, shall send his report with the necessary data and vouchers to the tribunal of accounts. The latter shall pass on the report within the following three months and in that period, and without prejudice to the effectiveness of its resolutions, shall report to Congress and to the executive branch the infractions or liabilities which in its judgment have been incurred. The definitive approval or rejection of the accounts rests with Congress. Allotments included in the budget for contingent expenses of the administration can be spent, when contingencies arise, only by a resolution of the cabinet. The executive branch shall forward to Congress monthly the balance sheets showing the revenues and expenses of the Nation. Art. 262. The executive branch shall avoid duplication of services and a multiplicity of official or semi-official agencies, totally or partially compensated by the Nation, for the accomplishment of its purposes. Art. 263. No one shall be compelled to pay any tax, toll, or contribution whatever that has not been expressly established by law or by the municipalities, in the manner established by this Constitution, and the amount of which is not going to form part of the revenues of the budget of the Nation, a province, or a municipality, except as otherwise provided in the Constitution or by law. The foregoing provision shall not be considered to comprise contributions or quotas imposed by law, in an obligatory manner, on persons or entities composing an industry, commercial business, or profession, in favor of their bodies recognized by law. Art. 264. The Nation, without prejudice to the other means within its power, shall regulate the development of the national wealth by means of the execution of public works to be paid for in whole or in part by those directly benefited. The adequate manner and procedure whereby the Nation, the province, or the municipality, on its own initiative or having recourse to private initiative, shall promote the execution of such works, grant the pertinent concessions, authorize the fixing, the assessment, and the collection of taxes for those purposes, shall be determined by law. Art. 265. The liquidation of each appropriation of government funds for the execution of any public work or service shall be published integrally in the official gazette of the Republic, as soon as it has received the approval of the corresponding minister. The instrument of approval, whether partial, total, provisional, or definitive, of every public work executed in whole or in part with funds furnished by the Nation, shall be published in the official gazette of the Republic, as soon as it has received the approval of the corresponding minister. Both the liquidation of appropriations of government funds and the definitive approvals of works executed by contract or by the administration, paid in whole or in part with funds furnished by the Nation, shall be

577

submitted for approval of the superior officer within sixty calendar days after termination of the works, without prejudice to the partial liquidations and approvals that are deemed proper by the administration during the process of execution of the works. Section Third The Tribunal of Accounts Art. 266. The tribunal of accounts is the body which audits the revenues and expenses of the Nation, the provinces, and the municipalities, and of the autonomous organizations, created by law, which receive their revenues directly or indirectly through the medium of the Nation. The tribunal of accounts is subject only to law, and its conflicts with other bodies shall be submitted for the decision of the Supreme Court. Art. 267.

Art. 272. The ownership and possession of real estate and the exploitation of agricultural, industrial, commercial, banking and any other kind of enterprises or business by foreigners located in Cuba, or who carry on their operations in Cuba although located outside thereof, are subject in an obligatory manner to the same conditions which the law establishes with respect to Cubans, which conditions must, in every case, accord with the social-economic interests of the Nation. Art. 273.

The lessee shall not be entitled to the said compensation if the contract is terminated ahead of time because of his fault, or when he refuses an extension offered him under the same conditions in force when the contract expires. Crop lien and cane-grinding contracts, as well as the delivery of other products by those who produce them, shall also be regulated by law, granting the former due protection. Art. 275. The planting and grinding of administration cane shall be regulated by law, being reduced to the minimum limit imposed by the social-economic need for maintaining the sugar industry on a basis of separation of the two large factors which concur in its development: industrialists or producers of sugar, and farmers or planters, producers of cane. Art. 276. Laws and provisions which create private monopolies, or which regulate commerce, industry, and agriculture in such a manner as to produce that result, shall be null and void.

TITLE EIGHTEENTH STATE OF EMERGENCY

Art. 281. Congress, by means of a special law, on request of the cabinet, can declare a state of national emergency and authorize the cabinet to exercise exceptional faculties in any case when the external safety or the internal order of the Nation is in danger or is attacked, by reason of war, catastrophe, epidemic, serious economic disturbance, or other cause of like nature. In each case the special law shall determine the concrete matter to which the exceptional faculties are to be applied, as well as the period during which they will govern, which shall never exceed forty-five days. Art. 282. During the state of national emergency the cabinet can exercise the functions that Congress expressly delegates to it. In like manner it can alter the criminal procedure. In every case, the legislative provisions adopted by the cabinet must be ratified by Congress, in order to continue to be effective after the state of national emergency ends. Judicial acts that modify the normal regimen can be reviewed at the instance of an interested party, when the state of emergency is over. In this event the case shall be reopened if a condemnatory sentence has been rendered, and the said sentence shall be considered merely as the act of indictment of the accused. Art. 283. The law which declares the state of national emergency shall necessarily contain a call for a special session of Congress on the day on which the emergency period ends. In the meantime a permanent commission of Congress must meet to watch over the use of the exceptional facilities granted to the cabinet, and can call Congress even before expiration of said period, in order to terminate the state of emergency. The permanent commission shall be elected from the membership of Congress and shall be composed of twenty-four members, an equal number coming from each co-legislative body and all political parties being also necessarily represented in its composition. The commission shall be presided over by the president of Congress and shall function when Congress is in recess and during the state of national emergency.

HeinOnline -- English translation of the original Constitution of 1940. 580 1940

Cuba

581

(c) Over the other matters attributed to it by the law of relations between the co-legislative bodies. Art. 284. The cabinet must give an account of the use of the exceptional faculties, before the permanent commission of Congress, at any time that the commission so resolves, and before Congress when the state of national emergency ends. The state of national emergency shall be regulated by a special law.
TITLE NINETEENTH REVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION

Art. 285. The Constitution can be revised only: (a) By initiative of the people, by means of presentation to Congress of the corresponding proposition, signed, before the electoral bodies, by not less than one hundred thousand voters who know how to read and write and inaccordance with what is established by law. When this has been done, Congress shall assemble as a single body and within the following thirty days shall
without discussion vote the proper law to call an election of delegates or a referendum; (b) By initiative of Congress, by means of the corresponding proposition,

signed by not less than one-fourth of the members of the co-legislative body to which the proponents belong.

Art. 286. Constitutional revision shall be specific, partial or complete. In case of a specific or partial revision, proposed by popular initiative, it shall be submitted to a referendum at the first election that is held, provided that the new precept that it is sought to incorporate, or the existing one that it is sought to revise, is susceptible of being proposed in such a manner that the people can approve or reject it by answering "yes" or
''no.,,

In case of a specific or partial renewal by initiative of Congress, its approval shall be necessary by a favorable vote of two-thirds of the total number of members of both co-legislative bodies, jointly assembled, and the said revision shall not be effective if it is not ratified in like manner within the following two regular sessions. In case the revision is complete, or relates to the national sovereignty, or to Articles 22, 23, 24, and 87 of this Constitution or to the form of the government, after the aforesaid requisites have been complied with, according to whether the initiative comes from the people or from Congress, an election shall be called for delegates to a plebiscitary assembly, which shall be held six months after it is resolved on and which shall limit itself exclusively to approving or rejecting the revisions proposed. This assembly shall fulfill its duties entirely independently of Congress, within the thirty days following its definitive constitution. The delegates to the said convention shall be elected by provinces, in the proportion of one for each 50,000 inhabitants or fraction in excess of 25,000 and in the manner established by law, and no congressman can be elected to the position of delegate. In case it is sought to accomplish a re-election constitutionally prohibited or the continuance in office of any officer for a period longer than that for which he was elected, the proposal for revision must be approved by three-fourths of the total number of the Congress, sitting as a single

Constitutions of Nations

body, and ratified at a referendum by the favorable vote of two-thirds of the total number of voters of each province. TRANSITORY PROVISIONS To TITLE SECOND First: Foreigners comprised in Sections 1, 2, 4, and 5 of Article 6 of the Constitution of 1901 shall retain the rights therein recognized, provided they meet the corresponding requisites. Second: The register of Spaniards opened in the department of state by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of 1901 and subsequent ones shall be definitively closed on April 11, 1950, and shall be sent to the national archives. Certificates of the registry of Spaniards issued up to that date of closing shall be valid at any time. After April 11, 1950, the procedure established in this Constitution shall be generalized for all foreigners. To TITLE THIRD Sole: Within three sessions following the promulgation of this Constitution, the law must establish penalties applying to violations of Article 20 of this Constitution. Until this legislation is in force, every act which violates the right established in that Article and those concordant with it shall be considered as included and penalized in Article 218 of the code of social defense. To TITLE FOURTH First: In the case of laws that are effective with respect to obligations of a civil character, Articles 22 and 23 shall be observed only with respect to those promulgated after this Constitution becomes effective. Second: With respect to the civil obligations that were subject to Decree-Laws 412, 423, and 594 of 1934, as modified by the Law of September 3, 1937, regardless of their present legal or contractual status and whether or not they have the benefit of the moratorium, and also with respect to those subsequent to August 14, 1934, and prior to September 4, 1937, but only when these latter refer to the payment of amounts proceeding or derived from the deferred price of cane plantations, sugar mills, or shares of stock representing the ownership of property of either of the two kinds, or it is so deduced from the aggregate of the contracts, pacts, or agreements between creditor and debtor, whatever the nature and form of the guarantees, the fulfillment of the said obligations shall be governed by the following rules: First: Principal which does not exceed $1,000 must be amortized on June 30, 1960. Principal comprised between $1,000 and $50,000 must be amortized on June 30, 1965, and, if it is greater than $50,000, on the same day of 1970. If the obligation is represented by bonds, certificates, obligations, or notes, the principal, for all the purposes of this transitory provision, shall be considered to be the total amount of the par values represented by those that were in circulation on August 14, 1934, or on September 3, 1937, according to the obligation involved, and the amortization payments shall be credited to them in the order of their respective annual maturities, according to the original contract, or pro rata if they have the same maturity. The amortizations shall be exactable in annual installments, the first being payable on June 30,

HeinOnline -- English translation of the original Constitution of 1940. 582 1940

Cuba

583

1942, but if on that date the period agreed upon by the parties has not lapsed, the said first annual installment shall be payable on June 30 following the maturity of the said installment. In all cases, the principal due must be distributed among the corresponding annual installments of amortization in a progressive manner, so that when combined with the amount due for interest, it will make the total of the annual payments for both items approximately equal, and in such a manner that the creditor shall be paid in full at the end of the period determined by the amount of the debt, as heretofore established. The principal amounts of censos are excepted from the provisions of this rule. Second: All interest in arrears that is due when this transitory provision becomes effective, as well as any amounts due for commissions, costs, fines, or other penalties, and similar items, even though said interest or amounts have been capitalized, shall be uncollectible; but from its effective date, the obligations in question shall bear interest according to the amount of principal, payable as determined by Decree-Laws 412 and 594 of 1934, and in accordance with the rate resulting for each one from application of the following scale: when the principal due does not exceed $15,000, the obligation shall bear interest at three per cent per annum; if it exceeds $15,000 but not $50,000 the obligation in question shall bear interest at two and one-half per cent per annum; when it exceeds $50,000, but not $200,000, it shall bear interest at two per cent; if it is in excess of $200,000 but not of £400,000, at one and three-fourths per cent; if it exceeds $400,000 but not $600,000, at one and onehalf; when it exceeds $600,000 but not $800,000, at one and one-fourth per cent; and, finally, when it exceeds $800,000, the obligation in question shall bear interest at one per cent per annum. The provisions of the present rule shall be applied to the obligations referred to in the initial paragraph of this transitory provision, whether or not they bear interest, whether the interest is agreed or legal, and regardless of what the agreed rate is, if there is one. In every cumulative loan, the principal shall be considered to be the amount actually received by the debtor at the time of execution of the document covering the obligation, and it shall be considered reduced by the amount of the payments made, after deductions have been made therefrom of the amount of the interest accumulated on each one. This principal thus reduced shall be amortized in the installments specified by rule first, or in a single amount at any time at the will of the debtor. All interest that has been accumulated on mortgage loans shall be eliminated and shall be null and uncollectible, so that in this manner interest shall be earned and be collectible only on the unpaid part of the principal. This provision shall also be applicable to the principal of censos and other perpetual liens specified in Moratorium Decree-Laws 412, 123, and 594 of 1934, as modified by the Law of September 3, 1937. Third: The obligations to which the initial paragraph of this transitory provision refers, as far as they affect natural or juridical persons who are owners of sugar mills, as debtors-or guarantors, shall also be subject to what is established in rules first and second, provided that such obligations secure debts specifically contracted with direct or indirect guarantee of sugar mills or cane plantations or result from supplies, financing, rentals, or services owed by said mills; but the amount of the annual payments that can be exacted of them as a credit, first, to the interest, and thereafter to the amortization of the principal, shall be limited according to the following bases: (a) When a pound of centrifugal raw sugar in warehouse at port is quoted at less than 1.40 cents per Cuban pound on an average during the crop, no payment can be exacted of them on account of the annual installment to become due on the following June 30, and the amounts representing amortization and interest of the said annual installment shall be covered by the payments that are found to be exactable in future.

HeinOnline -- English translation of the original Constitution of 1940. 583 1940

Constitutions of Nations (b) If the average price of sugar exceeds the limit specified, there must be destined to the said payments, whether they represent the current annual installment or any that have been left unpaid in accordance with the preceding base, three per cent of the gross value of the raw sugar manufactured in the crop in which this occurs, as long as the price does not exceed 1.50 cents per pound; from 1.50 cents to 2 cents, there shall be an increase of four hundredths of one per cent for each one-hundredth of a Pentavo of intrease, in the average price of a pound of sugar. (c) The amounts applicable to interest, or to principal, when there are any applicable to principal, shall be prorated among the various *creditors, if necessary, in accordance with the amounts which they are respectively entitled to receive in compliance with the present transitory provision. (d) When in any crop the official average price reaches 2 cents or more per pound, five per cent of the value of the sugar produced in that crop and pertaining to the mill, that is, excluding the sugar necessary to pay the price of the cane ground, shall be applied as a special amortization for the year in question, and ten per cent additional instead of the five per cent when the price exceeds 2.50 cents, without such special amortizations, eliminating the obligation of the exactable amortizations that the debtor must pay. (e) On expiration of the period determined by rule first, the creditor shall be entitled to claim all that is due him for principal and interest exactable in accordance with this transitory provision. Fourth: With respect to the obligations proceeding or derived from the deferred price of lots bought on installments, prior to August 15, 1934, regardless of the principal amount due, the amortization shall be effected in thirty years, as an exception to what is provided on these points in rules first and second, which shall be applicable thereto in all else, and in no case will interest be paid. This rule shall be applied only to lots the deferred price of which does not exceed $3,000. In the case of judicial sale of a lot sold on installments, because of a failure to pay the price, the value of the buildings constructed thereon by the buyer or his successors shall be appraised in the judicial proceedings, deducting from the amount fixed the value that reasonably represents the use and enjoyment of said buildings. The net amount resulting from the appraisal thus made shall be paid to the debtor by the one who purchases the property at the sale, or by the creditor, as the case may be, as indemnity, before the ownership of the property is conveyed to him. The exception to which paragraph second of this rule refers shall not govern with respect to the obligations to which it refers, if the lot thus acquired is situated in places of not less than twenty thousand inhabitants. Fifth: As a supplement to what is established in the foregoing four rules, the provisions of Decree-Laws 412 and 594 of 1934, as modified by the sugar coordination Law of September 3, 1937, shall be applied, but without altering what is established in the said rules and without prejudice to the provisions of the law of July 10, 1939. Sixth: With reference to the obligations granted a moratorium by DecreeLaw 423 of 1934, as modified by the law of September 3, 1937, and also with respect to the debts for the deferred price of cane plantations, subsequent to August 14, 1934, and prior to September 4, 1937, the provisions of the said legal texts shall be observed instead of applying the foregoing rules; but the moratorium which the said texts establish shall be understood as extended until June 30, 1960, on the same terms as at present in force. Like treatment shall be applied to the mortgages of rural properties devoted to the cultiva-

tion of sugar cane, comprised in the initial paragraph of this transitory provision, to the extent that the natural or juridical person who was the owner, lessee, or usufructuary of the sugar mill, to which the cane plantation or plantations established on the land in question is or are bound, was on September 3, 1937, a creditor by reason of the said mortgages, but the provisions of the preceding rule second shall also be observed with respect to the said mortgages. Seventh: In the case of pignorative claims comprised in this transitory provision, when the pledgee has reserved to himself, or limited with respect to the owner of the shares, the right to vote the shares pignorated, these rules shall be observed. (a) The creditor cannot vote the said shares in any manner that will produce, directly or indirectly, to the detriment of the company or of the owner of the shares, the loss or diminution of any of the benefits which this transitory provision grants them, or compel the owners thereof to vote in a manner that would produce those results. (b) The shareholder can vote, in the manner directed by the statutes of the company, to make contracts of sale, lease, or any other operations relative to its properties, as well as to borrow money on the security of the said properties, provided that the rights of the pledgee, as regulated in this transitory provision, are guaranteed; and to that end it will not be necessary that the owner of the shares pignorated physically exhibit the shares at any meeting or meetings where those resolutions are adopted, provided that he accredits his character as such and the amount of the stock possessed, by the books of the company or by means of documents which he presents. Eight: The provisions of the preceding rules shall not be applied with respect to those obligations which, in virtue of judicial or extrajudicial proceedings intended to collect them or to exact their fulfillment, have, prior to the date of promulgation of this transitory provision, resulted in the award of all of the encumbered property to the creditor or a third person, except in case that by a final decision of the courts the award has been or is declared null. If award of only part of the property has been made, this rule shall be observed with reference to the property awarded, and the other rules shall be observed with respect to the part of the obligation which is still legally exactable, which, for the purposes of this transitory provision, shall be considered to be divided into as many obligations as there are mortgagors, or properties individually encumbered. In the case of mortgages on urban properties comprised in title third of Decree-Law No. 412, of August 14, 1934, with respect to which the creditor and debtor have made agreements subsequent to the promulgation thereof, such obligations shall be excluded from this transitory provision, provided there is evidence in writing and the debtor continues to enjoy the full benefits granted him by the said agreements. Any amount paid in excess of what was required to be paid in accordance with Decree-Laws 412 and 594 of 1934 shall be applied to the payments that are to be made in accordance with this provision, provided the debtor has not received any benefit in compensation for the said payment in excess. Ninth: Obligations secured by pledge prior to September 4, 1937, can be collected only from the property specifically encumbered in the contract, the right of personal action against the debtors or their guarantors being consequently extinguished. Tenth: Notwithstanding what is provided in the initial paragraph of this transitory provision, in the case of debts contracted by reason of the deferred price of sale of sugar mills or cane plantations purchased between August 15, 1934, and September 3, 1937, the period for amortization shall be reduced by

Constitutionsof Nations one-fourth, but the reduction cannot exceed five years; but in all else the foregoing rules shall also be applied to the said debts. Eleventh: In the cases in which any creditor takes charge of a sugar mill in order to obtain reimbursement of any claim comprised in this moratorium, or of any other debt, it shall be an indispensable requisite therefor that he previously obligate himself to continue to operate it in each sugar crop, if the said mill was operated in the two crops prior to the date on which it was taken over. The chief executive shall issue the proper measures to insure compliance with this obligation. Twelfth: The provisions of this transitory provision shall also be applied to the obligations contracted prior to August 14, 1934, as debtors, by natural or juridical persons who on the promulgation hereof are at the same time creditors by reason of claims subjected to the foregoing rules, provided they are comprised in title fourth of Decree-Law No. 412 of 1934, or guarantee the fulfillment of such obligations by encumbering as security therefor mortgages which are subject to liquidation in accordance with the said rules, in an amount at least equal to that necessary so that the security thus given will cover what is exactable from them for principal and interest, in accordance with this transitory provision and by virtue of the present rule. Thirteenth: There are excluded from the benefits of these moratoria: (a) The obligations excepted in article 59 of Decree-Law No. 412, of August 14, 1934; (b) Mortgages constituted to secure deposits, administrative or judicial bonds, executorships, and usufructs; (c) Obligations in which the Nation, the provinces, and the municipalities are debtors; (d) Those contracted by underwriters or employers by reason of pensions or indemnities arising from the workmen's compensation law; (e) Obligations contracted by public service companies the functions of which are to furnish electricity, gas, water, or telephone service, even though as organizations affiliated with or dependent on them they have ownership rights over sugar mills or cane plantations. The provisions of Section (e) of this Rule, with respect to public service companies, shall not be applicable to companies that have a capital of less than one hundred thousand dollars and are not dependent on, affiliated with, or subsidiary to other enterprises.

This transitory provision of the Constitution, while the constitutional law of June 11, 1935, is in force, shall also form part thereof; its application shall not be subject to the restrictions or limitations established or that may be established with respect to the retroactivity of laws and to their efficacy to annul or modify civil obligations arising from the contracts, acts, or omissions producing them; it shall be effective from its promulgation, which shall be made when it is read aloud by the chairman of the constitutional convention, and for the purposes of its publication a certified copy of it shall be sent to the official gazette of the Republic.

When those hospitals pass integrally to the University of Havana, and likewise during the three years mentioned in the preceding paragraph, their budget allotment cannot be less than that which is in force at present and shall be fixed in the budget of the ministry of health and social welfare. Third: In a period of not more than three sessions, Congress shall proceed to enact a law of general revision of education.

These co-operatives shall be under the supervision of -the government of the Republic and shall be governed and administered by their co-operators, with representation of the municipality, the province, and the Nation, and under the chairmanship of the representative of the lastnamed; but these representatives cannot of themselves decide any ballot. The funds of these co-operatives shall be constituted principally by the amount contributed by the Nation, the province, the municipality and the small quotas of the co-operators fixed by law; by the reimbursement of the capital invested in agricultural implements, seeds, houses and lots awarded; by the other contributions that the co-operative resolves upon; and by any donations made to it.

Fifth: The present patent and trade-mark law, contained in DecreeLaw No. 805, of April 4, 1936, shall supplementarily govern with respect to what is not particularly specified in the foregoing transitory provisions.
