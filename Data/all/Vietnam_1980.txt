CONSTITUTION of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam PREAMBLE Throughout their four-thousand year history, the Vietnamese people have worked hard and fought heroically to build and defend their country. This long and persistent struggle for independence and freedom has fostered the staunch and indomitable tradition of our nation. Since 1930, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam founded and forged by President Ho Chi Minh, and following the path of the great Russian October Revolution, our people successively defeated the Japanese, French and American imperialists and their henchmen. They have completed the people's national democratic revolution, and have embarked on a socialist revolution and are building socialism. Our country, formerly a colony and a semi-feudal country, has become an independent, reunified, socialist state, a member of the world socialist community. In 1945, following the defeat of fascism by the Soviet Army, our people successfully carried out the August Revolution. On September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Declaration of Independence. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the first worker-peasant state in Southeast Asia, was born. However, the French colonists, with the assistance of U.S. imperialism, invaded our country once again. Our people, who "would rather sacrifice all than lose our country and be enslaved," waged a long struggle against the invaders, and carried out a program of land reform. The great victory at Dien Bien Phu brought a glorious end to the war of resistance against the French colonialists. In 1954, the Geneva agreements were signed on the basis of recognition of Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. The victory of the August revolution and that of the anti-French resistance signalled the beginning of the collapse of colonialism throughout the world. Stepping into the French colonialists shoes, the U.S. imperialists turned South Vietnam into a neo-colony and military base of the United States, in an attempt to permanently partition our country, and to include South Vietnam, Loas and Kampuchea into a counter-revolutionary front. Pursuing this scheme, they conducted an extremely barbarous war of aggression against Vietnam. Imbued with the truth that "nothing is more precious than independence and freedom," our people fought heroically, determined to liberate the South, defend the North and reunify the country. The successive victories of the Vietnamese people, together with the victories of the peoples of Laos and Kampuchea, compelled the U.S. imperialists to sign the 1973 Paris agreement on Vietnam. In the spring of 1975, the Vietnamese people won total victory in a general offensive and uprising which culminated in the historic Ho Chi Minh campaign. After 30 years of hard fighting, South Vietnam--the "iron fort of the homeland"--was completely liberated.

While our entire people were struggling against the U.S. war of aggression, for national salvation, great achievements were recorded in the socialist revolution in the North: institution of socialist relations of production, abolition of the regime of human exploitation, building of the initial material and technical infrastructure of socialism, conduct of an ideological-cultural revolution, execution of the dual tasks of production and fighting, and fulfillment of the obligations of the great rear base towards the heroic South in the war of resistance to U.S. aggression. The victories of the peoples of the three Indochina countries as a whole, and the Vietnamese people in particular, in the war against U.S. aggression, heralded the complete bankruptcy of neo-colonialism, contributed to the consolidation and extension of the world socialist system, encouraged the national liberation movements and the workers' and democratic movements, and accelerated the offensive of the three revolutionary currents of the present era. Following the complete liberation of the South, our people held free general elections throughout the country, and achieved national reunification. In July 1976, our country adopted the name of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. No sooner had they emerged from thirty years of liberation war than our people, who were longing for peace to build their homeland, were confronted with the Chinese hegemonist aggressors and their henchmen in Kampuchea. Promoting our glorious national traditions, our army and people won resounding victories in both wars for national defense against the aggression by Kampuchean reactionaries on the southwestern border and the Chinese hegemonists on the northern border, safeguarding our independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. Credit for the great successive victories of the Vietnamese revolution goes to the Communist Party of Vietnam which has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism, charted a correct line to lead the revolution in our country; upheld the two banners of national independence and socialism; consolidated the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class; closely united all social strata within the national united front; built and developed the people's armed forces; constantly strengthened the revolutionary administration; combined patriotism with proletarian internationalism, combined the strength of our people with the world revolutionary movement; and coordinated the struggles on the political, military and diplomatic planes. These are victories of the ardent partriotism, the revolutionary heroism and the sublime spirit of sacrifice of our compatriots and combatants throughout the country who are of one mind in struggline for national liberation, construction and defense. They are victories of the militant solidarity and the relations of cooperation and mutual assistance between the peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea; of the military solidarity and great and effective aid of the Soviet Union and other fraternal socialist countries to the Vietnamese revolution; and of the forces of national independence, democracy and peace throughout the world which have actively supported the just cause of the Vietnamese people. Our achievements have cost our people untold sacrifices and innumerable hardships. Our future is very bright, but our tasks are very difficult. Let our entire people strengthen unity and act upon the sacred testament of our great President Ho Chi Minh, and advance enthusiastically along the line charted by the Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam: "To firmly enforce the proletarian dictatorship: promote the working people's right to collective mastery of society; to

2

simultaneously implement the three revolutions, namely the revolution in the relations of production, the scientific and technological revolution, and the ideological and cultural revolution, with the scientific and technological revolution as the kingpin; step up socialist industrialisation which is the central task of the period of transition to socialism; establish the system of socialist collective mastery and large-scale socialist production, develop the new culture and foster new, socialist-oriented people; abolish the regime of human exploitation and eliminate poverty and backwardness; maintain constant vigilance and continuously strengthen national defence,; maintain political security and social order; successfully build our homeland, Vietnam, into a peaceful, independent, unified and socialist country; actively contribute to the struggle of the world's peace for peace, national independence, democracy and socialism." The Socialist Republic of Vietnam needs a constitution institutionalizing the current line of the Communist Party of Vietnam in the new stage. It is the constitution of the period of transition to socialism on a national scale. Continuing and developing the constitutions of 1946 and 1959, this constitution sums up and affirms the gains of the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people over the past half century, expre-ses the will and aspirations of the Vietnamese people, and guarantees the successful development of Vietnamese society in the coming period. Being the fundamental law of the state, the present constitution determines our political, economic, cultural and social system, the basic rights and obligations of citizens, the organizational structures and principles guiding the activities of state bodies. It specifies the relationships between the party's leadership, the people's mastery, and state management in Vietnamese society. Let the entire Vietnamese people unite closely under the invincible banner of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and put this constitution into effect in order to attain further great successes in the cause of building socialism and defending our socialist homeland. Chapter 1 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam Political System Article 1 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is an independent, sovereign and united country comprising its mainland, air space, territorial waters, and off-shore islands. Article 2 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a state of proletarian dictatorship. Its historic mission is to establish the collective mastery of the working people; mobilize and organise the people to carry out simultaneously the three revolutions: in the relations of production, in science and technology, and in ideology and culture, with the scientific and technological revolution as the king-pin; abolish human exploitation; crush all acts of opposition by counter-revolutionary elements in the country and all acts of aggression and sabotage by external enemies; build socialism successfully and advance to communism; and contribute to consolidating peace and accelerating the revolutionary cause of the people throughout the world.

Article 3 In the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the collective masters are the working people, with the worker-peasant alliance, led by the working class, as the core. The state ensures the continuous perfection and consolidation of the working people's collective mastery in the political, economic, cultural and social fields; collective mastery in the whole country and in each unit; collective mastery over society, over nature, and over oneself. Article 4 The Communist Party of Vietnam, the vanguard and general staff of the Vietnamese working class, armed with Marxism-Leninism, is the only force leading the state and society, and the main factor determining all successes of the Vietnamese revolution. The party exists and struggles for the interests of the working class and the people of Vietnam as a whole. Its organisations operate within the framework of the constitution. Article 5 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a unified state of all the nationalities living on Vietnamese territory, with equality in rights and obligations. The state protects, strengthens and consolidates the great unity of all nationalities; it strictly prohibits any act of racial prejudice and any attempt to sow discord among nationalities. All the nationalities have the right to use their own spoken languages and scripts, and to preserve and promote their fine customs, habits, traditions, and cultures. The state accepts responsibility to take corrective measures to gradually eliminate inequalities in the levels of economic and cultural development between the different nationalities. Article 6 In the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, all power belongs to the people. The peoples exercise state power through the National Assembly and the People's Councils at all levels which are elected by and accountable to the people. The National Assembly and the People's Councils at all levels are the political bases of the system of state organisations. The National Assembly, the People's Councils at all levels and other state bodies are organised and function according to the principle of democratic centralism. Article 7 National Assembly deputies and deputies to People's Councils at all levels are elected by universal suffrage. Voting is equal, direct and secret. Electors have the right to recall National Assembly deputies and deputies to People's Councils at all levels who lose the confidence of the people. 4

Article 8 All state bodies and all state employees must devotedly serve the people, maintain close relations with them, listen to them and accept their supervision, and promote socialist democracy. All manifestations of bureaucratism, arrogance and authoritarianism are strictly prohibited. Article 9 The Vietnam Fatherland Front, which comprises the various political parties, the Vietnam Confederation of Trade Unions, the Vietnam Association of Collective Peasants, the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union, the Vietnam Women's Union, and other member organisations, is a firm prop of the state. The front promotes the tradition of national unity, strengthens political and moral unity among the people, takes part in building and consolidating the people's power, educates and motivates the people to raise their sense of collective mastery, and to emulate one another in building socialism and defending the country. Article 10 The Vietnam Confederation of Trade Unions is the largest mass organisation of the Vietnamese working class, a school of communism, of economic management, and management of state. Within the limits of their competence, the trade unions take part in state affairs and supervise the work of state bodies, and participate in the management of factories. They educate workers and office employees; organise socialist emulation movements, and, together with state bodies, care for the lives of workers and office employees and protect their interests. Article 11 Collectives of working people at offices, factories, cooperatives, population centres and other basic units participate in state and social affairs including the planning of economic and cultural development, the protection of public property, the maintenance of political and social security and public order, and the organisation of public life at the grassroots levels. Article 12 The state manages society according to law, and constantly strengthens the socialist legal system. All state organs and social organisations, all state employees, all members of social organisations and all citizens must strictly abide by the constitution and law, and must struggle resolutely to prevent and oppose crimes and violations of the constitution and law. Article 13 Our socialist homeland, Vietnam, is sacred and inviolable. All schemes and actions prejudicial to the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the homeland, or the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction shall be severely punished. 5

Chapter 2 The Economic System Article 15 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is advancing directly from a society in which small-scale production predominates to socialism, bypassing the stage of capitalist development, to build a society with a modern industrial-agricultural economy, advanced culture, science and technology, a strong defence potential, and a civilized happy life. The economic policies of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam are aimed at progressively satisfying increasing material and cultural needs of the whole society by continuously developing production and raising social labour efficiency, on the basis of socialist collective mastery and modern science and technology. Article 16 The central task throughout the period of transition to socialism is the socialist industrialisation of the country.

Article 24 The state encourages, guides and assists individual farmers, handicraft workers and other self-employed workers to advance towards the road of collective production, to form production cooperatives and other forms of mutual aid collectives on the principle of voluntariness.
