General Provisions Article 1. The peoples of the twenty-two sovereign cantons of Switzerland united by the present alliance, that is to say Zurich, Bern, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden (Upper and Lower), Glaris, Zug, Freiburg, Soleure, Basel (Urban and Rural), Schaffhausen, Appensell (the two Rhodes), Saint Gall, Grisons, Aargau, Thurgau, Ticino, Vaud, Valais, Neuchatel, and Geneva, form together the Swiss Confederation. Art. 2. The Confederation has as its object to assure the independence of the country against foreign aggression, to maintain domestic order and tranquillity, to protect the liberty and rights of the Confederates and to increase their common prosperity. Art. 3.. The cantons are sovereign in so far as their sovereignty is not limited by the federal constitution, and, as such, they exercise all the powers which are not delegated to the federal government. Art. 4. All Swiss are equal before the law. In Switzerland there are neither subjects, nor privileges of place, birth, person, or family. Art. 5. The Confederation guarantees to the cantons their territory, their sovereignty within the limits fixed by Article 3, their constitutions, the liberty and rights of the people, the constitutional rights of citizens, â€¢ as well as the rights and powers which the people have conferred on their authorities. _ Art. 6. The cantons must demand of the Confederation the guaranty of their constitutions. This guaranty is granted, provided: (a) That these constitutions contain nothing contrary to the provisions of the federal constitution; (b) that they assure the exercise of political rights according

to republican forms, representative or democratic ; (c) that they have been accepted by the people and that they can be amended whenever an absolute majority of the citizens demand it. Art. 7. All separate alliances and all treaties of a political nature between cantons are forbidden. On the other hand, the cantons may make treaties among themselves relating to legislation, administration or justice; nevertheless, they must bring them to the attention of the federal government, which, if these treaties contain anything adverse to the Confederation or the rights of other cantons, is authorized to prevent their execution. In the opposite case the cantons have the right to demand the cooperation of the federal authorities in their execution. Art. 8. The Confederation alone has the right of declaring war and concluding peace, as well as making alliances and treaties with foreign states, especially tariff and commercial treaties. Art. 9. As an exception, the cantons preserve the right of concluding treaties with foreign states concerning the administration of public property, and border and police regulations; nevertheless these treaties must not contain anything adverse to the Confederation or to the rights of the other cantons. Art. 10. Official relations between the cantons and foreign governments or their representatives may take place only through the Federal Council. Nevertheless, the cantons may correspond directly with the inferior authorities and officers of a foreign state relative to the objects mentioned in the preceding article. Art. 11. No military capitulations' shall be made. Art. 12. Members of the federal departments of government, civil and military officers of the Confederation, and federal representatives or commissioners, shall not receive from a foreign government, pensions, salaries, titles, gifts or decorations.

Nevertheless, inferior officers may be authorized by the Federal Council to receive their pensions. No decoration or title granted by a foreign government may be worn in the federal army. Every officer, non-commissioned officer or soldier is forbidden to accept distinctions of this sort. Art. 13. The Confederation shall not maintain a standing army. No canton or half-canton may have a standing army of more than 300 men without the authorization of the federal government ; the gendarmerie' is not included in this number. Art. 14.

Art. 15. In case of sudden outside danger, the government of the canton threatened must request the aid of the confederated states and notify immediately the federal government, all without prejudice to the measures which it (Confederation) may take. The cantons requested are bound to give aid. The expenses are borne by the Confederation. Art. 16. In case of internal disorder, or when the danger proceeds from another canton, the government of the canton threatened must immediately notify the Federal Council, in order that it may take necessary measures within the limits of its power (Article 102, Secs. 3, 10, 11), or summon the Federal Assembly. When there is urgent necessity, the government1 is authorized, while giving immediate notice to the Federal Council, to request the assistance of other cantons which must grant it. When the government is not in a condition to invoke assistance, the competent federal authority may intervene without requisition; it is bound to do so when the disturbance compromises the safety of Switzerland. In case of intervention, the federal authorities shall see to it that the provisions prescribed in Article 5 are observed. The expense shall be borne by the canton which has requested the assistance or occasioned the intervention unless the Federal Assembly, on account of particular circumstances, decides otherwise. Art. 17. In the cases mentioned in the preceding articles, each canton shall grant free passage for troops. These troops shall immediately be placed under federal command. t Art. 18. Military service is required of every Swiss. Soldiers who, by reason of federal service, lose their lives, or have their health permanently impaired, shall be entitled to aid from the Confederation, for themselves or their families if they are in need of it. Each soldier shall receive gratuitously his first arms, equipment and clothing. The weapon shall remain in the hands of the soldier on conditions to be fixed by federal legislation. The Confederation shall enact uniform provisions as to the tax on exemption from military service. Art. 19. The federal army shall be composed of : (a) Corps of cantonal troops; (b) All Swiss, who, not belonging to these bodies, are nevertheless liable to military service. The control of the army, as well as of the war material provided by law, shall belong to the Confederation. In case of danger, the Confederation also shall have exclusive and direct control of the men not incorporated in the federal army, and of all other military resources of the cantons. The cantons shall have control of the military forces of their territory in so far as this right is not limited by the constitution or federal laws. Art. 20. Laws on the organization of the army shall emanate from the Confederation. Military laws shall be enforced in the cantons by the cantonal authorities, within the limits which shall
be fixed by federal legislation and under the supervision of the Confederation. Military instruction shall belong altogether to the Confederation ; this likewise applies to armament. The furnishing and maintenance of clothing and equipment shall remain within the competence of the cantons ; nevertheless, the expenses which result shall be made good to the cantons by the Confederation in accordance with a rule to be established by federal legislation. Art. 21. Unless military considerations prevent, corps must be formed of troops from the same canton. The composition of these corps of troops, the maintenance of their effective strength, the appointment and promotion of their officers shall belong to the cantons, subject to general rules which shall be transmitted to them by the Confederation. Art. 22. Upon the payment of a just indemnity, the Confederation shall have the right to make use of or acquire drill grounds and buildings intended for military purposes, situated in the cantons, together with their appurtenances. The terms of the indemnity shall be determined by federal legislation. Art. 23. The Confederation may construct at its expense, or encourage by subsidies, public works which concern Switzerland or a considerable part of the country. To this end it may order the taking of private property upon the payment of a just indemnity. Federal legislation shall establish further regulations on this subject. The Federal Assembly may forbid public works prejudicial to the military interests of the Confederation. Art. 24. The Confederation shall exercise supervision over the dike and forest police. 1 It shall cooperate in the correction of the channels and the diking of torrents, as well as the reforestation of the regions in which they rise.

Art. 24 (2). 2 The use of water powers shall be subject to the supervision of the Confederation. Federal legislation shall enact the general provisions necessary to safeguard the interests of the public and to assure the rational use of water powers. These provisions shall take account, as far as possible, of the interests of internal navigation.. Subject to these provisions, the regulation of the use of water powers shall belong to the cantons. Nevertheless, when a portion of a stream, the use of which is demanded in order to create a water power, rises within the jurisdiction of several cantons, and when there is no agreement between these cantons touching a common concession, it shall belong to the Confederation to grant the
concession. This is equally its right, after hearing the interested cantons, when the stream in question forms the boundary of the country. The fees and rents for the use of water powers shall belong to the cantons or to those having the right according to cantonal legislation. The Confederation shall fix, after hearing the interested cantons, and taking just account of their legislation, the fees and rents due for the concessions which it grants. The cantons shall determine, within the limits established by federal legislation, the fees and rents to be paid for other concessions. Electric energy produced by water power shall be sold abroad only with the authorization of the confederation. From the taking effect of this article, reservation shall be made in all new water power concessions for future federal legislation.

It shall be compulsory, and, in the public schools, free. The public schools must be so conducted that they may be attended by adherents of all faiths without their having to suffer in any wise in their liberty of conscience or belief. The Confederation shall take necessary measures against the cantons which do not satisfy these obligations. Art. 27 (2). 2 Subventions shall be alloted to the cantons to aid them in fulfilling their obligations in the domain of primary education. The execution of this provision is regulated by law. The organization, direction and supervision of the primary schools shall remain within the competence of the cantons, subject to the provisions of Article 27 of the federal constitution. Art. 28.

No one may exercise political rights in more than one canton. A Swiss, settled outside his native canton, shall enjoy, in the place of his residence, all the rights of citizens of the canton and commune. Participation in municipal and corporate property and the
right to vote in purely municipal affairs shall be excepted from these rights, unless cantonal legislation provides otherwise.
