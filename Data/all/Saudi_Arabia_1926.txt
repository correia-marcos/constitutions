Art. 5. The Council of Ministers derives its authority from His Majesty the King. The ministers are jointly responsible to His Majesty the King for the conduct of the general policy of the State, and personally responsible for the acts of their respective ministries. Art. 6.

Art. 8. The ministers may demand of one another explanations and the presentation of a written statement of what their colleagues have done with respect to a previous decision the execution of which was entrusted to one or more of them. The colleague responsible for such execution shall present such statement and, if he refuses and it is not possible to reconcile the parties, the question shall be submitted to His Majesty the King to relieve the parties of all responsibility.

Art. 11. If the President of the Council gives a minister an order for action upon a matter for which there are no written provisions in the existing decrees, or for which there has been no decision of the Council of Ministers, or if there is such a decision but the minister concerned is opposed thereto, the minister must execute such order immediately when it is in writing and based on a sovereign order dated and numbered, provided that, in case the sovereign order relied upon is not clearly expressed, the question shall be laid before His Majesty the King.

The Council shall meet each evening when the majority of its members are in the same place; in any event, a weekly meeting is necessary, by day or night, to attend to all the matters submitted to the Council

after the preparation which the bureau is required to make of such matters. Art. 13. The absence of a minister, on the occasion of discussions which require his presence because they concern his department, may not delay the work; the decisions shall be taken and notified as usual to the ministers, including the absent minister. If the minister concerned objects to a decision taken in his absence, he shall immediately explain his objections to the President and to his colleagues in order that the execution thereof may be suspended until a meeting and deliberation of the ministers. If no objection has been formulated, the decision shall be executed. The absence of objection by a minister within twenty-four hours of his receipt of notice of a decision taken in his absence shall be deemed to be approval by him unless he has a legitimate excuse for delaying objection; otherwise the decision is final.
