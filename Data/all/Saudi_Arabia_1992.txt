Title: Basic System of the Consultative Council (Decree A/90) Date Published: 03/01/1992 Country: Saudi Arabia Copyright: Saudi Press Agency (SPA), reproduced with permission Translation Type: Unofficial Translator: Saudi Press Agency (SPA) SAUDI PRESS AGENCY (SPA) DAILY ENGLISH SERVICE SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1992 RIYADH, MARCH 1, SPA—KING FAHD IBN ABDULAZIZ AFFIRMED TODAY THAT SAUDI ARABIA HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT IS CALLED ‘THE CONSTITUTIONAL VACUUM’ THROUGHOUT ITS LONG HISTORY AND SAID THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE BASIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, THE CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL AND THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEM IS JUST AN AUTHENTICATION OF SOMETHING WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN IN EXISTENCE. IN A SPEECH ADDRESSED TO THE NATION ON THE OCCASION OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE THREE SYSTEMS, THE CUSTODIAN OF THE TWO HOLY MOSQUES KING FAHD IBN ABDULAZIZ SAID THE CONCEPT OF ‘THE CONSITUTIONAL VACUUM’ AS A TERM MEANS THE LACK OF GUIDING PRINCIPLES, COMPULSORY BASES AND FUNDAMENTAL REFERENCES IN THE FIELD OF LEGISLATION AND ORGANIZATION OF RELATIONS. “THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE HISTORY, THE KINGDOM HAS NEVER WITNESSED SUCH PHENOMENON BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN RULED UNDER GUIDING PRINCIPLES, COMPULSORY BASES AND CLEAR-CUT FUNDAMENTALS WHICH HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO BY RULERS, JURISTS, SCHOLARS AND STATE PERSONNEL,” KING FAHD ADDED. KING FAHD SAID ALL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AT PRESENT ARE PROCEEDING ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS STEMMING FROM THE ISLAMIC SHARIA AND GOVERNED BY THEM. “AS SUCH THE ISSUANCE OF THE BASIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, THE CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL AND THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEM IN THEIR NEW DRAFTS HAVE NOT EMANATED FROM A VACUUM. “THE THREE SYSTEMS ARE JUST AN AUTHENTICATION OF SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE,” KING FAHD SAID. KING FAHD SAID THE SYSTEMS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO EVALUATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO THE INTERESTS AND CONDITIONS OF THE KINGDOM.

“THE THREE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DRAFTED ACCORDING TO THE ISLAMIC SHARIA AND EXPRESS OUR GENUINE TRADITIONS, CUSTOMS AND CORRECT NORMS,” THE SAUDI MONARCH SAID. “THE PILLAR AND SOURCE OF THE BASIC SYSTEM IS THE ISLAMIC SHARIA, KING FAHD SAID. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN GUIDED BY THE ISLAMIC SHARIA IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE NATURE OF THE STATE, ITS GOALS AND RESPONSIBILITIES, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULER AND THE SUBJECTS.” THIS RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON FRATERNITY, ADVICE, GOOD WILL AND COOPERATION, KIND FAHD SAID. “RELATIONS BETWEEN CITIZENS AND AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN BASED ON FIRM GROUNDS AND DEEP-ROOTED TRADITIONS THAT ARE MARKED BY AMITY, MERCY, JUSTICE, MUTUAL RESPECT AND ALLEGIANCE STEMMING FROM DEEP-ROOTED CONVICTIONS.” “THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RULER AND A SUBJECT. ALL ARE EQUAL BEFORE THE DIVINE LAWS OF ALLAH. ALL ARE EQUAL IN THEIR LOVE TO THIS COUNTRY AND THEIR KEENNESS OVER ITS SAFETY, UNITY, DIGNITY AND PROGRESS. THE RULER HAS RIGHTS AND DUTIES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULER AND THE SUBJECT IS GOVERNED BY THE SHARIA LAWS.” “THE BASIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN INSPIRED BY THESE PRINCIPLES AND HAS STRIVED TO ENRICH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULER AND THE SUBJECT WITH FULL ADHERENCE TO THE TENETS OF ISLAM IN THIS CONNECTION.” “AS FOR THE CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL SYSTEM, IT HAS BEEN BASED ON ISLAM. ‘THOSE WHO HEARKEN TO THEIR LORD, AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYER, WHO CONDUCT THEIR AFFAIRS BY MUTUAL CONSULTATION, WHO SPEND OUT OF WHAT WE BESTOW ON THEM FOR SUSTENANCE,’” KING FAHD QUOTED THE HOLY QURAN. KING FAHD SAID THE KINGDOM WITNESSED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SHURA COUNCIL LONG AGO. DURING THIS PERIOD SHURA WAS PRESERVED WITH VARIOUS AND DIFFERENT FORMULAS, AND THE RULER OF THE KINGDOM CONSULTED ULEMA AND MEN OF THOUGHT WHENEVER THE NEED AROSE. “THE NEW SYSTEM FOR THE CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL IS AN UPDATE AND MODERNIZATION OF WHAT IS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE THROUGH THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE FRAMEWORKS OF THE COUNCIL, ITS MEANS AND

METHODS WITH MORE EFFICIENCY, ORGANIZATION AND VITALITY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED GOALS OF THE COUNCIL.” “THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL SHALL BE THOROUGHLY SELECTED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE KINGDOM WHILE TAKING CARE OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY AND ITS CITIZENS.” “THE KINGDOM HAS WITNESSED HUGE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PAST PERIOD IN ALL FIELDS. THIS DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED THE MODERNIZATION OF THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM OF THE COUNTRY, AND IN ORDER TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT AND THE INTEREST, THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A PROPER ADMINISTRATIVE LEAP FORWARD AND TO UPGRADE THE STANDARD OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RULE IN THE KINGDOM’S VARIOUS REGIONS.” “THESE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DRAWN AFTER A DELIBERATE AND THOROUGH STUDY BY A GROUP OF EXPERTS AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE DISTINGUISHED STATUS OF THE KINGDOM IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD, ITS TRADITIONS, VALUES, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FABRIC.” “THE SYSTEMS EMANATED FROM OUR REALITY, IN HARMONY WITH OUR CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS AND ADHERENCE TO OUR RELIGION.” “WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE SYSTEMS, WITH THE GRACE OF GOD, SHALL BE OF AID TO THE STATE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE WELLBEING, PROGRESS AND PROSPERITY OF THE SAUDI CITIZEN, HIS COUNTRY AND HIS ISLAMIC AND ARAB NATION.” “THE SAUDI CITIZEN IS THE MAIN PILLAR OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESS OF HIS COUNTRY. WE SHALL SPARE NO EFFORT TO ACHIEVE HIS HAPPINESS AND WELFARE,” KING FAHD SAID. “THE WORLD THAT FOLLOWS UP THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESS OF THIS COUNTRY LOOKS FORWARD WITH DEEP APPRECIATION TO ITS DOMESTIC POLICY WHICH CONCENTRATES ON THE SECURITY OF THE CITIZEN AND HIS STABILITY, MAINTAINS A MODERATE FOREIGN POLICY AND IS ALSO KEEN ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, AND CONTRIBUTES TO ALL EFFORTS SEEKING TO BOOST THE PILLAR OF PEACE IN THIS WORLD.” KING FAHD HIGHLIGHTED THE STRENUOUS EFFORTS MADE BY THE KINGDOM TO EXPAND AND DEVELOP THE TWO HOLY MOSQUES AND TO EXTEND EVERY POSSIBLE SERVICE TO THE PILGRIMS.

KING FAHD SAID THE KINGDOM HAS, THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, ADHERED TO ISLAM IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE. “ISLAM IS A WAY OF LIFE AND WE SHALL NOT PART WITH WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THE HOLY BOOK OF GOD, KING FAHD SAID, AND ADDED THAT THE KINGDOM’S CONSTITUTION IS THE HOLY BOOK AND THE SUNNAH OF THE PROPHET (PBUH).” RULERS AND ULEMA IN THE KINGDOM HAVE BEEN AND ARE STILL COOPERATING, AND THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AND ARE STILL IN COHESION AND FORGE COOPERATION WITH THEIR RULERS. KING FAHD SAID THE SAUDI COMMUNITY IS ENJOYING SECURITY, STABILITY AND WELFARE. THE SAUDI MONARCH NOTED THE KINGDOM’S ISLAMIC AND ARAB ROLE AND ITS KEENNESS TO MAINTAIN THE SOLIDARITY AND UNITY OF MUSLIMS AND ARABS. “EVENTS AND FACTS VERIFIED THE TRUENESS OF THE KINGDOM’S STANDS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TOWARD THE ISLAMIC AND ARAB NATION AS WELL AS ITS OTHER INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.” KING FAHD SAID THE KINGDOM WILL REMAIN COMMITTED TO ITS ISLAMIC WAY OF LIFE AND WILL COOPERATE WITH ANY ONE WHO WISHES WELL-BEING TO ISLAM AND MUSLIMS. HE ALSO REAFFIRMED THE KINGDOM’S KEENNESS TO SPREAD ISLAM AND WISHED THE SAUDI PEOPLE AND THE ISLAMIC AND ARAB NATION MUCH PROGRESS, WELL-BEING, HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY.
