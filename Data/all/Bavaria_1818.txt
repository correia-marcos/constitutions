Guided and steeped in the exceptionally important duties of the regent, We have forged an identity for Our hitherto existing government with arrangements that certify Our continuous endeavor to advance the collective well-being of Our subjects. In order to build a firmer foundation for this, We already gave Our Kingdom a constitution in the year 1808, appropriate for the external and internal relations at the time, in which We already introduced an Estates assembly and incorporated it as a fundamental component of our Kingdom.The monumental and unprecedented world events that did not leave a single German State untouched, and during which the people of Bavaria immediately demonstrated themselves to be great both while suffering under the pressure and while surviving in battle had hardly reached their goal in the Act of the Wiener Congress when We began to seek to fulfill the requirements of Our State.We sought with an unwavering gaze to achieve Our goal, Our work only being interrupted by the events at that time. The preliminary works arranged to this end in the year 1814 and the decree from the 2nd of February 1817 attest to the firm determination We already possessed at an earlier date. The present act is, after advanced mature and multilateral consulting, and after the examination of Our State council, the work of Our both free and determined desire. Our people will find in its contents the strongest guarantee of Our disposition towards the country of Our Fatherland. 
Freedom of conscience, and the conscientious separation and protection of that which is of the State and that which is of the Church. 
Freedom of opinion, with lawful restrictions against misuse. 
The same rights of all natives to all degrees of State service and to all designations of merit. 
The same call to the duty and honor of carrying weapons. 
Equality of laws and before the laws. 
Evenhandedness and persistence in the administration of justice. 
Equality in the allocation and the obligation of services. 
Order throughout all parts of the State housekeeping, legal protection of State credit, and assured usage of the means designated to be employed for that cause. 
The revitalization of the community body through the refurnishing of the administration of matters concerning their well-being to those closest to them. 
A union of Estates emerging from all classes of citizens residentiary in the State, with the rights of council, of approval, of consent, of requests and of registering complaints regarding the violation of constitutional rights, convening in a public assembly in order to strengthen the wisdom of council without weakening the power of the government. 
Finally a protection of the constitution, securing the State against arbitrary changes, but not hindering the amelioration process after evaluating experiences. 
Bavaria! These are the main features of the constitution given to you out of Our free resolution. See in it the principles of a King who only finds happiness in his heart and renown for his throne in the felicity of his Fatherland and love for his people! 
We declare the following regulations to be the constitution of the Kingdom of Bavaria:

Article 4. The male line has priority over the female descendants, and the princesses are barred from taking on governmental positions as long as there still exists either a male heir from the house of the King who is able to succeed to the throne, or a prince who has been qualified for succession to the throne through an inheritance-brotherhood. 
Article 5. After complete elimination of the male line and lacking an inheritance-brotherhood which has been completed with another princely house in the German Federation for this circumstance, the heirship shall fall to the female descendants according to the order of succession fixed for the male line. This shall occur in such a way that at the time of the passing of the last ruling King, the next living Bavarian princess or her descendant shall be called to the throne, regardless of gender, and as if this heir were a prince of the original male line of the Bavarian house, according to the right of the first born and linear order of succession. 
If descendants of the first rank of both genders are born into the new house of the King, the priority of the male gender over the female shall again come into effect. 
Article 6.

Article 11. If the Monarch should be hindered from exercising the rights and powers of the government for any reason and this hindrance should last for longer than a year, and he himself has not made a decision regarding provisions for such a circumstance, nor can he, the same lawful regency shall occur as would if the successor to the crown were under age.
