SECTION I.-OF THE NATION.
CHAPTER I.-OF THE PERUIiAN NATION.

ART. I. All the Provinces of Peru, united in one Body, form the Peruvian Nation. II. The Nation is independent of the Spanish Monarchy, and of all Foreign Authority, and cannot be the patrimony of any Person or Family. III. The Sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation, and its exercise in the Magistrates to whom the Nation, has delegated its Powers. IV. If the Nation do not preserve or protect the legitimate Rights of all Individuals composing the same, it invades the social compact, in the same manner as he who violates any of the Fundamental Laws withdraws himself from the safeguard of this Compact. V. The Nation does not possess the power of decreeing Laws which encroach upon Individual Rights. CHAPTER .TERRITORY.

VI. Congress shall fix the Boundaries of the Republick, in concert with the neighbouring States, as soon as the total Independence of Upper and Lower Peru shall have been accomplished. VII. The Territory is divided into Departments, the Departments into Provinces, the Provinces into Districts, and the Districts into Parishes.
CHAPTER II.-RELIGION.

VIII. The Religion of the Republick is the Roman Catholick Apostolick, to the exclusion of the exercise of any other. IX. It is the duty of the Nation constantly to protect Religion, by all means consistent with the spirit of the Gospel, as it is the duty of every Inhabitant of the Republick, inviolably to respect it.
CHAPTER IV.-POLITICAL STATE OF PERUVIANS.

X. Are Peruvians: 1. All Men of free condition born in the Territory of Peru. 2. The offspring, though born out of the Country, of a Peruvian Father or Mother, from the moment they legally manifest their intenilon of settling in Peru. 3. Those who have been naturalized in it, either by Letters of Naturalization, or by having become legitimate Citizens, in consequence of a residence of 5 Years in the Republick. . XI. No Person can be born a Slave in Peru, nor can any one re-enter the Country in that condition. The Slave-trade is abolished.

XII. If a Peruvian be convicted of this Traffick, he shall forfeit his rights of Nativity. XIII. A Foreigner engaged in this Trade cannot be naturalized in Peru. XIV. The duties enjoined by natural justice are obligations which it particularly behoves every Peruvian to perform; and he renders himself unworthy of this Name, who is not religious, who does not love his Country, who is not just and beneficent, who is unmindful of the dignity of the Nation, or who fails to fulfil his duty towards himself. XV. Fidelity to the Constitution, obedience to the Laws, and respect for the Authorities, make every Peruvian responsible, so that the least violation of these duties involves delinquency. XVI. The defence and support of the Republick, either by Arms, or Contributions, impose on every Peruvian an obligation commensurate with his ability and means. XVII. To be a Citizen it is necessary: 1. To be a Peruvian. 2. To be either married, or upwards of 25 Years of Age. 3. To be able to read and write; which qualification, however, will not be required till after the Year 1840. 4. To possess property; to exercise some profession, or art, publickly known; or to be engaged in some useful branch of industry, without being subject to any Person in the capacity of Servant or Journeyman. XVIII. Any Foreigner, who has obtained a Letter of Citizenship, is also a Citizen. XIX. To obtain such Letter, he must, in addition to the qualifications specified in Article XVII. have introduced, or established, or taught, in the Country, some invention, branch of industry, science, or useful art; or have acquired landed property which obliges him to pay direct Contributions; or must carry on Trade, Husbandry, or Mining, with a considerable Capital; or, finally, have performed distinguished Services for, or in defence of, the Nation; all subject, however, to the decision of Congress. XX. Married Foreigners who have resided 10 Years, and Bachelors )vho have resided 15 Years in the Republick, are likewise Citizens; although neither may have obtained a Letter of Citizenship; provided they be true to the Cause of Independence, and possess the qualifications enumerated in Article XVII. XXL These Regulations shall be modified, in respect of the Natives of other Independent Countries of America, according to the reciprocal arrangements which may be concluded with this Republick. I XXII. Citizens alone are eligible to Employments, Offices, or Posts of the Republick, and can exercise the right ef Election in the Cases already fixed by the Law. This Regulation does not, however,

 703 


704

PERU.

prevent Peruvians, who have not yet entered upon the rights of Citizenship, from holding Employments which do not, in other respects, require a legal Age. XXIII. All Citizens are equal in the eye of the Law, either as regards reward or punishment. Every hereditary Employment and Privilege is abolished. XXIV. The exercise of Citizenship is suspended, solely: 1. By physical or moral incapability of acting freely. 2. By being of the condition of a menial Servant. 3. By the ignominy attaching to Bankruptcy, or to dilatoriness in discharging Debts due to the Publick Treasury. 4. By not possessing any known Employment, Office, or'means of livelihood. 5. By being under Criminal Prosecution. 6. By the abandonment of a Wife without just cause, or by being notoriously wanting in the ordinary duties towards Children. 7. By being a Gambler, Drunkard, Vagabond, or addicted to vicious conduct, giving offence to publick morals. 8. By bribery at Elections. XXV. The right of Citizenship is forfeited, solely: 1. By Naturalization in a Foreign Country. 2. By having suffered a painful or degrading punishment, if the Party be not restored to his former condition; which restoration, however, is not to extend to Traitors to their Country, unless upon such considerations as shall be deemed satisfactory by Congress. XXVI. The Conditions set forth in this Chapter, after being legally investigated, shall be observed every 5 Years, in the arrangement of the Constitutional Census; out of which the Civic Register of the whole Republick shall be formed. SECTION II.-OF THE GOVERNMENT.
