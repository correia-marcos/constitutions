(3) The office of Prime Minister or any other Minister shall become vacant: (a) if he ceases to be a member of the Assembly otherwise than by reason of a dissolution of Parliament; or (b) if, at the first sitting of the Assembly after any general election, he is not a member of the Assembly: Provided that paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not apply to the office of Attorney General if the holder thereof was not a member of the Assembly in the preceding dissolution of Parliament.

(1) There shall be a Secretary to the Cabinet, whose office shall be a public office.

(1) In order to ensure a fair and adequate representation of each community, there shall be eight seats in the Assembly, additional to the sixty-two seats for members representing constituencies, which shall so far as is possible be allocated to persons (if any) belonging to parties who have stood as candidates for election as members at the general election but have not been returned as members to represent constituencies. (2) As soon as is practicable after all the returns have been made of persons elected at any general election as members to represent constituencies, the eight additional seats shall be allocated in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph by the Electoral Supervisory Commission which shall so far as is possible make a separate determination in respect of each seat to ascertain the appropriate unreturned candidate (if any) to fill that seat.

(3) The first four of the eight seats shall so far as is possible each be allocated to the most successful unreturned candidate if any who is a member of a party and who belongs to the appropriate community, regardless of which party he belongs to. (4) When the first seats (or as many as possible of those seats) have been allocated, the number of such seats that have been allocated to persons who belong to parties other than the most successful party shall be ascertained and so far as is possible that number of seats out of the second four seats shall one by one be allocated to the most successful unreturned candidates (if any) belonging both to the most successful unreturned candidates (if any) belonging both to the most successful party and to the appropriate community. (5) In the event that any of the eight seats remains unfilled, then the following procedure shall so far as is possible be followed until all (or as many as possible) of the eight seats are filled, that is to say, one seat shall be allocated to the most successful unreturned candidate if any belonging both to the most successful of the parties that have not received any of the eight seats and to the appropriate community, the next seat (if any) shall be allocated to the most successful unreturned candidate (if any) belonging both to the second most successful of those parties and to the appropriate community, and so on as respects any remaining seats and any remaining parties that have not received any of the eight seats. (6) In the event that any of the eight seats still remains unfilled, then the following procedure shall so far as is possible be followed (and, if necessary, repeated) until all (or as many as possible) of the eight seats are filled, that is to say, one seat shall be allocated to the most successful unreturned candidate (if any) belonging both to the second most successful party and to the appropriate community, the next seat (if any) shall be allocated to the most successful unreturned candidate (if any) belonging both to the third most successful party (if any) and to the appropriate community, and so on as respects any remaining seats and parties. (7) If at any time before the next dissolution of Parliament one of the eight seats falls vacant, the seat shall as soon as is reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the vacancy be allocated by the Electoral Supervisory Commission to the most successful unreturned candidate (if any) available who belongs to the appropriate community and to the party to whom the person to whom the seat was allocated at the last general election belonged: Provided that, if no candidate of the appropriate community who belongs to that party is available, the seat shall be allocated to the most successful unreturned candidate available who belongs to the appropriate community and who belongs to such other party as is designated by the leader of the party with no available candidate. (8) The appropriate community means, in relation to the allocation of


any of the eight seats, the community that has an unreturned candidate available (being a person of the appropriate party, if the seat is one of the second four seats) and that would have the highest number of persons (as determined by reference to the results of the latest published official census of the whole population of Mauritius) in relation to the number of seats in the Assembly held immediately before the allocation of the seat by persons belonging to that community (whether as members elected to represent constituencies or otherwise), if the seat were also held by a person belonging to that community: Provided that, if, in relation to the allocation of any seat, two or more communities have the same number of persons as aforesaid preference shall be given to the community with an unreturned candidate who was more successful than the unreturned candidates of the other community or communities (that candidate and those other candidates being persons of the appropriate party, if the seat is one of the second four seats). (9) The degree of success of a party shall, for the purposes of allocating any of the eight seats at any general election of members of the Assembly, be assessed by reference to the number of candidates belonging to that party returned as members to represent constituencies at that election as compared with the respective numbers of candidates of other parties so returned, no account being taken of a party that had no candidates so returned or of any change in the membership of the Assembly occurring because the seat of a member so returned becomes vacant for any cause; and the degree of success of an unreturned candidate of a particular community) at any general election shall be assessed by comparing the percentage of all the valid votes cast in the constituency in which he stood for election secured by him at that election with the percentages of all the valid votes cast in the respective constituencies in which they stood for election so secured by other unreturned candidates of that particular community (or, as the case may be, of that particular party and that particular community), no account being taken of the percentage of votes secured by any unreturned candidate who has already been allocated one of the eight seats at that election or by any unreturned candidate who is not a member of a party: Provided that if, in relation to the allocation of any seat, any two or more parties have the same number of candidates returned as members elected to represent constituencies, preference shall be given to the party with an appropriate unreturned candidate who was more successful than the appropriate unreturned candidate or candidates of the other party or parties. (10) Any number required for the purpose of sub-paragraph (8) of this paragraph or any percentage required for the purposes of sub-paragraph (9) of this paragraph shall be calculated to not more than three places of decimals if it cannot be expressed as a whole number.
