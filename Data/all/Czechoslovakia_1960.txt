CONSTITUTION of CZECHOSLOVAKIA'
July 11, 1960 DECLARATION I. We, the working people of Czechoslovakia, solemnly declare: The social order for which whole generations of our workers and other working people fought, and which they have had before them as an example since the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, has become a reality in our country, too, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Socialism has triumphed in our country! We have entered a new stage in our history, and we are determined to go forward to new and still higher goals. While completing the socialist construction of our country, we are proceeding towards the construction of an advanced socialist society and gathering strength for the transition to communism. We shall continue along this road hand in hand with our great ally, the fraternal Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and all the other friendly countries of the world socialist system, of which our Republic is a firm part. We desire to live in peace and friendship with all nations of the world and contribute to peaceful co-existence and to good relations among countries with different social systems. Through a consistently peaceful policy and through the comprehensive development of our country we shall help to convince all nations of the advantages of socialism, which alone can bring well-being for all mankind. Fifteen years ago, in 1945, our working people, following their liberation by the heroic Soviet Army from the yoke of fascist occupation, decided in the light of their experience with a bourgeois republic to build up their newly-liberated country as a people's democracy whose objective 1 Constitution of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, third edition, published in

Czechoslovakia

would be to ensure peaceful development towards socialism. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the proved vanguard of the working class, steeled in struggle under the bourgeois Republic and during the occupation, took its stand at the head of the Republic. The last major attempt of international and domestic reaction to reverse this development was defeated by the determined action of the working people in February, 1948. Thus our working people first freed themselves from the shackles of foreign rule and then from capitalist exploitation and became masters of their country. In the last fifteen years they have, by their work and purposeful efforts, achieved successes in all fields of human endeavor which would be inconceivable under capitalism. The advantages of the socialist system have been demonstrated clearly and convincingly in this country, too. The face of our country has undergone a fundamental transformation. Our economy is expanding as never before. Production is increasing from year to year and the living standard of all working people is constantly rising. There are no longer any exploiting classes, exploitation of man by man has been eliminated forever. There are no longer economic crises or unemployment. Education and culture are becoming the common property of all the working people. The two nations, Czechs and Slovaks, which created the Czechoslovak Republic, live in fraternal harmony. By building socialism together they have made it possible for Slovakia rapidly to overcome its former backwardness and achieve an advanced level of industry and agriculture. The Czechoslovak State, into which the working people led by the working class organized itself, has become a people's organization in the truest sense of the word—a socialist State. In our country all the main tasks of the transition from capitalist to socialist society have already been solved. Emancipated human labor has become the basic factor throughout our society. It is now not only a duty but a matter of honor for every citizen. We are already practising the the socialist principle: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work." People's democracy, as a way to socialism, has fully proved its worth; it has led us to the victory of socialism. All our efforts are now directed at creating the material and moral conditions for the transition of our society to communism. While developing socialist statehood we shall perfect our socialist democracy by increasing the direct participation of the working people in the administration of the State and in the management of the economy, con-

solidating the political and moral unity of our society, safeguarding the defence of our country, cherishing the revolutionary achievements of the people and providing conditions for the development of all their creative abilities. At a later stage, in which work becomes the primary necessity of life, it is our intention to expand the forces of production and multiply the wealth of society to such a degree that it will be possible to provide for all the growing requirements of society and for the full development of each of its members. It will then be possible to proceed to the realization of the highest principle of distribution—the principle of communism: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." In order to consolidate the results achieved by the struggle and labor of our people, and at the same time to show our unbreakable will to advance to still higher objectives, we enact this day the following socialist Constitution of our Republic.
