They may be reelected or designated for some other board or council, provided their conduct has not been subject to objection by the Tribunal of Accounts by a vote of at least five of its members. Art. 197. The outgoing councils or boards of directors must submit an accounting of their work to the Executive Power, after report by the Tribunal of Accounts, without prejudice to liabilities incurred, in accordance with the provisions of Section XII.

The request must be made in writing through the intermediary of the president of the Board, who shall immediately transmit it to the Council. If the Council does not furnish the information within a period of twenty days, the member of the Departmental Board may request it through the intermediary of the Board itself. Art. 285. The Board is empowered, by a resolution adopted by onethird of all its members, to cause the Departmental Council to appear before it in order that it may request and receive such information as it may deem suitable, for either legislative or supervisory purposes. The Council, in this event, shall be represented by the Councillor or Councillors it may designate, who may be accompanied by any officials of its staff considered necessary acting under the responsibility of the Councilors selected. Art. 286. The Departmental Board may appoint investigating committees to obtain such data as is considered necessary in carrying out its functions, and the Council and offices subordinate to it are required to furnish the data requested. Chapter VII Art. 287. In any community beyond the city limits of the capital of a Department there may be a Local Council whose members shall be appointed, in so far as possible, on the basis of the proportional representation of parties on the Departmental Board. There shall be five members who shall have the same qualifications as are required for members of the Departmental Board and they must be residents of the locality; members of the Departmental Council or Board may not be members. Its president shall represent the Local Council and execute its resolutions. Art. 288. The law shall prescribe the conditions for the creation of the Local Councils and their powers, and by an absolute majority of votes of the full membership of each Chamber and at the initiative of the respective Departmental Government may broaden their scope of action in communities which though not the capital of a Department have over ton thousand inhabitants or are of special national interest for the develop-

menu of tourist travel. The law may also, by meeting the same requirements, provide that the members of these autonomous Local Boards shall be elected by the people. Chapter VIII Art. 289. The office of Councillor is incompatible with any other public office or employment with the exception of teaching, or with any other personal situation in which a salary or remuneration is received for services to an enterprise under contract with the Departmental Government. Councillors may not make contracts with the Departmental Government. Art. 290. Employees of a Departmental Government or persons receiving a salary or remuneration for services to private enterprises under contract with a Departmental Government may not be members of Departmental Boards or of Local Councils. Likewise, those officials mentioned in paragraph four of article 77 may not be members of these bodies. Art. 291. Councillors, and members of the Departmental Boards or the Local Councils, during their term of office, are likewise prohibited from:
(1) Acting as directors or administrators of enterprises which contract for works or supplies for a Departmental Government or for any other public agency related thereto ; (2) Handling or conducting business for themselves or for third parties with the Departmental Government.

Art. 292. Violation of the provisions of the preceding articles shall result in immediate dismissal from office. Art. 293. The position of member of a Departmental Board is incompatible with that of Councillor, but this provision shall not apply to members of Departmental Boards who are called upon to hold the position of Councillor temporarily. In this event, their functions as members of the Departmental Board will be suspended and the position occupied, during the suspension, by their alternates. Art. 294. The offices of Councillor and members of Departmental Boards are incompatible with the exercise of any other elective public office, regardless of its nature. Chapter IX Art. 295. The positions of members of the Departmental Boards and of the Local Councils shall be honorary. Councillors shall receive such remuneration as may be fixed by the Departmental Board prior to their election. The amount may not be changed during their term of office. Art. 296. Councillors and members of a Departmental Board may be impeached by the Senate by a vote of one-third of the members of the Departmental Board, on the grounds provided in article 93. The Senate may separate them from office by a two-thirds vote of its full membership.

Chapter X Art. 297. The sources of revenues of the Departmental Governments, decreed and administered by them, shall be the following:
(1) Taxes on real property located within their jurisdiction, excluding improvements on rural real property, and with the exception of national - supplementary taxes in existence or subsequently imposed ; (2) The tax on idle lands (baldios) and on inappropriate building construction in urban and suburban districts of cities, towns, villages, and populated centers ; (3) Taxes levied for the benefit of the Departmental Governments and those that may be imposed by law in the future for the same purpose on sources not enumerated in this article ; (4) Special levies for improvements to real estate benefited by departmental public works ; (5) Excises, fees and charges for the utilization, supply, or benefits obtained from services supplied by the Departmental Government, and special taxes on enterprises holding exclusively departmental concessions ; (6) Taxes on public entertainment with the exception of those established by law for special purposes until they are repealed, and taxes on transport vehicles ; (7) Taxes on advertisements and announcements of all kinds. Excepted therefrom are press and radio advertising as well as political, religious, trade union, cultural and sports advertising and any others that the law may exempt by an absolute majority of the full membership of each Chamber; (8) Profits obtained from games of chance already authorized or subsequently authorized by law, in such form and under the conditions established therein ; (9) Taxes on horse racing and other competitive sports in which mutuel betting is used, with the exception of those exempted by law until it is repealed ; (10) Proceeds from fines : (a) as established by the Departmental Government, until repealed or that may be established under its powers ; (b) as established by laws in effect, for the benefit of the Departmental Governments ; (c) that may be established by new laws, for the benefit of the Departmental Governments ; (11) Income from property owned by the Departmental Government and the proceeds from sales thereof; (12) Gifts, inheritances and legacies made to it and accepted.

Art. 298. The law, by a two-thirds vote of the full membership of each Chamber, may extend the scope of Departmental taxation or broaden the sources that may be taxed, provided that double taxation will not result. Art. 299. The decrees of the Departmental Governments creating or changing taxes shall not be enforced until ten days after publication in the Diario Oficial and they shall be published in a special section of the Register of Laws and Decrees (Registro Nacional de Leyes y Decretos). They must also be published in at least two newspapers in the Department. Art. 800. The National Council of Government, within fifteen days following their publication in the Diario Oficial, may appeal to the General Assembly against decrees of the Departmental Governments which create

or change taxes, on grounds of the public interest. Such appeal is suspensive in effect. If no action is taken on the appeal in the General Assembly in joint session, within sixty days after receipt, the appeal is considered void. Within fifteen days after an appeal has been submitted to the General Assembly, it may request, once only, any necessary supplementary information, and the sixty-day period is interrupted until this is received. A recess of the General Assembly interrupts any of the periods mentioned in the foregoing. Art. 301. The Departmental Governments may not issue certificates of municipal public debt except with the consent of the Council, approved by the Board, and based on a report by the Tribunal of Accounts, and with the approval of the Legislative Power by an absolute majority of the votes of the full membership of both Chambers. Contracts for borrowing money shall require the initiative of the Council and approval by an absolute majority of votes of the members of the Departmental Board, following a report by the Tribunal of Accounts. If the period of the loan is to exceed the term of office of the Council which proposes it, the loan must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the full membership of the Departmental Board. Art. 302. Any surplus must be applied in full to special amortizations of departmental obligations. If there are no obligations, it shall be used for the execution of public works or for remunerative investments through the adoption of a resolution by the Departmental Board, proposed by the Council and following a report by the Tribunal of Accounts. Chapter XI Art. 303. Decrees of the Departmental Board and resolutions of the Departmental Council which are contrary to the Constitution or the laws, not susceptible of being taken before the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, shall be appealable to the General Assembly within fifteen days after their promulgation, by one-third of the members of a Departmental Board or by one thousand citizens registered in the Department. In the latter case, and when the decree appealed is for the purpose of increasing departmental revenues, the appeal shall not have suspensive effect. If within sixty days following receipt of the facts by the General Assembly, the appeal is not acted upon by a joint session, the appeal shall be considered as not having been taken. The General Assembly, within fifteen days after it has been notified of the appeal, may request, once only, any desired supplementary information, and the period for action is interrupted until this has been received. A recess of the General Assembly interrupts the periods fixed in the foregoing. Chapter XII Art. 304. The law, by an absolute majority of votes of the full membership of each Chamber, may introduce the referendum as a recourse against decrees of the Departmental Boards.

Likewise, by an absolute majority of the votes of the full membership of each Chamber, the law may introduce and regulate the right of popular initiative in affairs of the Departmental Government. Art. 305. Fifteen percent of the registered residents of a locality or district specified by law shall have the right of initiative before the organs of the Departmental Government in matters affecting that jurisdiction. Art. 306. The police force shall lend its cooperation to the Departmental Boards and Councils and to the Local Councils, whenever this is required for the fulfillment of their functions.
SECTION XVII THE CONTENTIOUS-ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL

Chapter I Art. 307. There shall be a Contentious-Administrative Tribunal (Tribunal de lo Contencioso-Administrativo) which shall be composed of five members. In cases of vacancy and as long as these are not filled, and in the event of challenge, excuse, or disability to fulfill the jurisdictional function, the places shall be filled in such manner as may be prescribed by law. Art. 308. The qualifications necessary for members of this Tribunal, the manner of their appointment, the prohibitions and incompatibilities, their remuneration and term of office shall be those established for members of the Supreme Court of Justice. Chapter II Art. 309. The Contentious-Administrative Tribunal shall hear pleas for the nullification of definitive administrative acts performed by the government in the exercise of its functions which are contrary to a rule of law or which are a distortion of authority. The Tribunal shall also have jurisdiction over definitive administrative acts of the Departmental Governments, the Autonomous Entities, and the Decentralized Services. Action for nullification may be taken only by one who has a right or a direct, personal and legitimate interest which is violated or injured by the administrative act. Art. 310. The Tribunal shall limit itself to appraising the act in itself, confirming or annulling it, without alteration. In issuing a decision all members of the Tribunal must concur, but a simple majority is sufficient to declare the annulment of an act contested on grounds of injury to a subjective right. In other cases, annulment of an act shall require four favorable votes. However, the Tribunal shall reserve to the complaining party the right to sue for redress if three favorable votes declare the grounds for annulment sufficiently justified. Art. 311. Whenever the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal declares the annulment of an administrative act contested on grounds of injury to

a subjective right of the plaintiff, the decision shall have effect solely in the case acted upon. If the decision declares the annulment of an act with respect to a rule of law or of good administration, it shall have general and absolute effect. Art. 312. When annulment has been declared or the right of action for redress reserved, as the case may be, the claim for redress must be entered in the ordinary courts to determine the damages incurred. The law, by a three-fifths vote of the full membership of each Chamber, may broaden the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by giving it the right to hear claims for redress. Art. 313. The Tribunal shall, in addition, act upon conflicts of jurisdiction based upon legislation and upon the differences that may arise between the Executive Power, the Departmental Governments, the Autonomous Entities and the Decentralized Services, and likewise upon disputes or differences arising between one and another of these organs. It shall act also upon disputes or differences that may arise among the members of the Departmental Councils and Boards, the directorates or councils of the Autonomous Entities and Decentralized Services, provided they have not been settled by the normal procedure for ascertaining the will of the agency concerned. All disputes based on the Constitution shall be heard by the Supreme Court of Justice. Chapter HI Art. 314. There shall be a State Attorney (Procurador del Estado) in the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, appointed by the National Council of Government. The qualifications necessary for this position, the prohibitions and incompatibilities, as well as its remuneration and term of office, shall be determined by the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal. Art. 315. The State Attorney in the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal shall necessarily be heard at the final hearing on all matters within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The State Attorney is independent in the exercise of his functions. Consequently he may render opinions according to his convictions based upon what he believes to be the intent of the law. Art. 316. The defendant official may have such representation or counsel as he may consider necessary. Chapter IV Art. 317. Administrative acts may be contested by a plea for reversal, before the same official who issued the orders, within a period of ten days counted from the day following personal notification, if such was the case, or following publication in the Diario Oficial. If the administrative act was executed by an official subject to higher authority, it may also be contested by a plea to that authority, who shall become jointly and subsidiarily a party to the plea for reversal. If the administrative act comes from an authority which under its

juridical statutes is subject to administrative supervision, it may be contested on the same grounds for annulment as provided in article 309, by a petition for annulment before the National Council of Government, which must become a party jointly and subsidiarily to the plea for reversal. If the act issues from an organ of the Departmental Governments it may be contested by a plea for retrial and appeal in the manner provided by law. Art. 318. Every admimistrative authority is required to act upon any petition submitted by a person having a legitimate interest in the execution of a specific administrative act and to act upon any administrative pleas against his decisions, after taking such steps as may be necessary for due understanding of the matter, within a period of twenty days from the date of enforcement of the last act imposed by law or by applicable regulation. The petition is considered denied or the plea rejected if the authority in question does not act within the indicated time limit. Art. 319. Action for annulment before the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal may not be taken if appropriate previous remedies in administrative channels have not been exhausted. Action for annulment must be taken, under penalty of forfeiture, within the period prescribed by law in each case.
Chapter V

Art. 320. The law may, by a three-fifths vote of the full membership of each Chamber, create subordinate organs within the contentious-administrative jurisdiction. These organs shall be appointed by the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, in accordance with whatever the law may prescribe on the basis of provisions covering the Judicial Power, and they shall be subject to its directive, disciplinary, advisory and economic supervision. Art. 321. The Contentious-Administrative Tribunal shall prepare its budgets and transmit them in due course to the Executive Power for inclusion in the draft general budget with such modifications as may be deemed pertinent.
SECTION

XVIII

Chapter I

Art. 322. There shall be an Electoral Court which shall have the following powers in addition to those established in Section III or which may be prescribed by law: (a) To act in all matters relating to electoral acts or procedures ; (b) To exercise directive, disciplinary, advisory, and economic supervision over electoral organs ; (c) To render final decision on all appeals and claims that may arise, and act as judge of the elections to all elective offices, and of plebiscites and referendums.

Art. 323. In budgetary and financial matters, the provisions of Section XIII shall apply. Art. 324. The Electoral Court shall be composed of nine members and twice as many alternates. Five members and their alternates shall be appointed by the General Assembly in joint session by a two-thirds vote of its full membership, and they must be citizens who by virtue of their position in the political scene afford a guarantee of impartiality. The four remaining members, representatives of the parties, shall be elected by the General Assembly by the system of the double simultaneous vote, two to be selected from the majority list of the party having the most votes and two from the majority list of the party with the next highest number of votes. Art. 325. The members of the Electoral Court may not be candidates for any office requiring election by the people, unless they resign and terminate their functions at least six months before the date of the election. Art. 326. The resolutions of the Electoral Court shall be adopted by a majority vote and to be valid must have the affirmative vote of at least three of the five members to which paragraph 1 of article 324 refers, unless they are adopted by a two-thirds vote of the full membership. Art. 327. The Electoral Court may annul the elections in whole or in part, this step requiring an affirmative vote of six members, three of which must be members elected by the two-thirds vote of the General Assembly. In such event it must call for a new election—in whole or in part— which shall take place on the second Sunday following the date of nullification. Art. 328. The Electoral Court shall communicate directly with the Public Powers.
SECTION XIX THE OBSERVANCE OF FORMER LAWS

Enforcement and Amendment of the Present Constitution Chapter I Art. 329. There are hereby declared to be in full force and effect the laws which up to the present time have governed in all matters and points which are not directly in conflict with this Constitution or with the laws issued by the Legislative Power. Chapter II Art. 330. Any person who attacks or who is instrumental in attacking the present Constitution, following its sanction and publication, shall be regarded, tried, and punished as guilty of treason. Chapter III Art. 331. The present Constitution may be amended, in whole or in part, in accordance with the following procedures:

(a) Upon the initiative of ten percent of the citizens inscribed in the National Civic Register, by presenting a detailed proposal which shall be referred to the President of the General Assembly, to be submitted for popular decision at the next election. The General Assembly, meeting in joint session, may make substitute proposals which shall be submitted to plebiscitary decision together with the popular initiative. (b) By proposal of amendment approved by two-fifths of the full membership of the General Assembly, presented to the President thereof, and submitted to plebiscite at the next ensuing election. For an affirmative result in the methods outlined in paragraphs a) and b), a "yes" vote of an absolute majority of the citizens participating in the elections shall be required, and this majority must represent at least thirty-five percent of all persons inscribed in the National Civic Register. • (c) The Senators, Representatives, and the Executive Power may present proposed amendments which must be approved by an absolute majority of the full membership of the General Assembly. A proposal which is rejected may not be renewed until the succeeding legislative period, and the same formalities must be observed. Upon the approval of a proposal and its promulgation by the President of the General Assembly, the Executive Power, within ninety days thereafter, shall call for the election of a National Constituent Convention, which shall consider and decide upon approved proposals for amendment as well as upon any other proposals that may be presented to the convention. The number of members of the Convention shall be double the number of legislators. Twice as many alternates shall be elected at the same time. The conditions for eligibility and the immunities and incompatibilities shall be the same as for Representatives. The election by departmental lists shall be governed by the system of integral proportional representation and in accordance with laws in force for the election of Representatives. The Convention shall meet within one year from the date of promulgation of the proposal of amendment. The decisions of the Convention must be taken by an absolute majority of the whole number of members of the Convention and the work of the Convention must be terminated within one year from the date of its commencement. The proposal or proposals drawn up by the Convention shall be communicated to the Executive Power for immediate and full publication. The proposal or proposals drawn up by the Convention must be ratified by the body electorate convoked for the purpose by the Executive Power, on the date to be fixed by the National Constituent Convention. Voting shall be by "yes" or "no" and if there are several texts of amendment, it shall be separate for each of them. For this purpose the Constituent Convention shall group together those amendments which by their nature require that they be voted on as a unit. One third of the members of the Convention may require separate voting on one or several texts. An amendment or amendments must be approved by a majority of votes, which shall not be less than thirty-five percent of the citizens inscribed in the National Civic Register. In the cases contemplated by paragraphs (a) and (b), there shall be submitted for ratification by plebiscite at the same time as the next elections only those proposals which have been presented at least six months before the date of such elections, or in the first of these cases, three months before, for substitute proposals approved by the General Assembly. Proposals presented after the periods mentioned shall be submitted to plebiscite at the time of the subsequent elections. (d) The Constitution may be amended, also, by constitutional laws which shall require for their sanction two-thirds of the full membership of each Chamber in the same legislative period. Constitutional laws may not be vetoed by the Executive Power and shall take effect as soon as the

electorate specially convoked on the date specified in such laws shall have expressed their approval by an absolute majority of the votes cast and they shall be promulgated by the President of the General Assembly; (e) If the convocation of the electorate for ratification of amendments, in the cases contemplated in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) coincides with any election of members of the organs of the State, the citizens must express their will on the constitutional amendments on ballots separate and apart from the election lists. Whenever the amendments submitted to plebiscite relate to election to elective offices, the voting for such offices shall be both by the system proposed and by the existing system, and the decision of the plebiscite shall be final.

Chapter IV Art. 332. The provisions of the present Constitution which recognize individual rights, as well as those which confer powers and impose duties on public authorities, shall not be without effect by reason of the lack of corresponding regulations, but such regulations shall be supplied on the basis of analagous laws, general principles of justice, and generally accepted doctrines.
