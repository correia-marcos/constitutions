True to Tradition For our Future Strengthen Switzerland
Federal Decree on a new Federal Constitution

of December 18,1998
Introduction

The Swiss Confederation (Confoederatio Helvetica) traces its origin to the Confederal Pact of 1291. Switzerland's first Federal Constitution of 1803 was replaced by the Confederation Treaty of 1815, which was, in turn, replaced by the Federal Constitution of 1848. Numerous amendments to the Federal Constitution of 1848 were enacted through partial revision. A total revision resulted in the Federal Constitution of May 29,1874. Numerous amendments were enacted through partial revision. A total revision of the Federal Constitution of 1874 presently in force now leads to the new Federal Constitution. A written constitution is a major achievement of the democratic state based on the rule of law. It is the highest law of the state. It states the fundamental values of the political community, and it also sets the most important rules, those that make it possible to live together in freedom, peace, and security. The new Federal Constitution establishes the principles of our political organization: State based on the Rule of law and liberty, social state, direct democracy, and federal state. It guarantees the fundamental rights of human beings and protects them from arbitrariness. It also defines the tasks assigned to the Confederation, and allocates the tasks between the Confederation and the Cantons. It guarantees the participation rights of the People and defines the powers of the Federal Parliament, the Federal Government, and the Federal Supreme Court. The new Federal Constitution is organized in six titles. The Preamble provides a solemn introduction. It is followed by Title 1 which defines the nature of the Swiss Confederation through four important elements: Federal state, purpose of the Swiss Confederation, autonomy of the Cantons, and multilingualism. Title 2 deals with fundamental rights, civil rights, and social goals. It binds the Confederation and the Cantons. It enumerates some thirty fundamental rights and procedural guarantees that the person concerned may invoke before a court or administration. The social goals provide guidelines for the drafting of legislation concerning education, health, labor, housing, social security, and provide for special protection of families and children. In court, no direct subjective right to prestations by the state may be derived from these social goals. Title 3 spells out the organization of Switzerland as a federal state. First, it regulates the relationship between the Confederation and the Cantons. The central principle is that the Confederation shall fulfill only those tasks that require uniform regulation or

exceed the means of the Cantons. The Cantons may, in principle, exercise all rights that the Constitution does not attribute to the Confederation. The Constitution provides for cooperation between the Confederation and the Cantons, and for mutual respect and support. The Constitution also describes the position of the Municipalities, and, accordingly, the three-tiered construction of the state: Confederation, Cantons, Municipalities. In an extensive chapter, finally, the powers of the Confederation in various fields, such as environmental protection, health, or traffic, are described. The principles of the market-oriented economy1 are also set out. A further chapter deals with the finances. It states the most important principles of taxation, and enumerates the taxes that the Confederation may levy. Hardly another state provides for equally extensive participation rights of the People as Switzerland. The political rights in the Swiss Confederation are set out in Title 4. In particular, popular initiative and referendum are guaranteed. Title 5 contains the provisions on Federal Authorities. It regulates the organization and the procedure of the Federal Assembly, the Federal Government, and the Federal Supreme Court. The tasks and powers of these authorities are circumscribed precisely. Title 6 contains the provisions on the revision of the Federal Constitution and transitory provisions. The procedure for a partial or total revision of the Federal Constitution and its coming into force are found here. The transitory provisions have a validity limited in time. As may be seen from Title 6 just mentioned, as its predecessors, the new Federal Constitution will be subject to amendments. In fact, since December 18,1998, the Federal Constitution presently in force was amended twice. Its article 96 was amended to liberalize the requirements for membership in the Federal Government. This will be reflected in article 175, subs. 3, of the new Federal Constitution. A new article 24 dKics on transplantation medicine was introduced. It will be added to the new Federal Constitution. The new Federal Constitution is more comprehensive, easier to understand, and better organized than the Federal Constitution presently in force. This transparency is important, for a constitution also has an information function. The fundamental legal text of the state should, in a direct democracy, be accessible not only to lawyers. We therefore invite all citizens to make this Constitution their own.
