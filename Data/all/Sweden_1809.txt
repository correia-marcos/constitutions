CONSTITUTION OF SWEDEN
(June 6, 1809)

We the estates of the Swedish Kingdom, counts, barons, bishops, nobles, clergy, burghers, and peasants, assembled in general session on our own behalf and in behalf of our brethren at home, publicly declare that, whereas we the deputies of the Swedish people have gained the opportunity of improving the condition of our country through the establishment of a revised constitution in consequence of the recent change of government to which we have given our unanimous consent, we do hereby repeal the fundamental laws which have been more or less in force up to this time, viz.: the constitution of August 21, 1772, the act of union and security of February 21 and April 3, 1789, the Riksdag ordinance of January 24, 1617, and all other such old or new laws, acts, ordinances, enactments, or resolutions as have heretofore gone under the name of fundamental laws; and we do hereby make known the adoption of the following constitution for the Swedish Kingdom and its dependencies, which from henceforth shall be the foremost fundamental law of the land, reserving to this diet the right to adopt, in the manner herein prescribed, the other fundamental laws mentioned in Art. 85 of this constitution: ARTICLE I . Sweden shall .be governed by a king and shall be a hereditary monarchy with the order of succession established by the law of succession.1 ART. 2. The King shall always belong to the pure evangelical faith as adopted and explained in the unaltered Augsburg Confession and in the resolution of the Upsala Synod of 1593*By Art. 85 of the constitution the law of succession is included as one of the fundamental laws. The succession is regulated by law of September 26, 1810, which confirmed the election of Marshal Bernadotte, prince of Ponte Corvo, as crown prince of Sweden. The crown is transmitted in the male line in the order of primogeniture, to the exclusion of females and of their descendants.

If the minister of state is prevented from being present, the King shall summon another member of the Council of State in his place. If the minister for foreign affairs is absent the matter shall be presented by a member of the Council of State whom the King shall designate for that purpose. After having received and entered upon the minutes the advice of these officers, for which they are responsible, the King shall make his decision in their presence; the minutes of such meetings shall be kept by a person specially designated for this purpose. The King shall inform the Council of State of as much as he may think proper of such decisions, in order that they may also have some knowledge of this department of the government.

ART. 12. The King shall have power to conclude treaties and alliances with foreign powers after having, in the manner set forth in the preceding article, consulted the minister of state, the minister of foreign affairs, and one other member of the Council of State summoned for this purpose, or two other members of the Council of State, if the minister of foreign affairs is also minister of state. ART. 13.

The head of such department is bound, under his responsibility, to express his opinion upon the measures adopted by the King at the time when such measures are under consideration; should he disapprove of the decision of the King he shall enter his objections and advice upon a minute which the King shall verify by his royal signature. If this officer believes that the measures are of a dangerous character or tendency, or are founded upon resources uncertain or insufficient for their execution, he shall recommend, in addition, that the King summon into a council of war two or more of the higher military officers who may be at hand; the King shall, however, have the right to comply with or to reject the recommendation for a council of war; if he approves it he may take such action as he thinks best with reference to the opinion of the council of war, which shall be entered upon the minutes.

The judicial power of the King shall be vested in not less than twelve nor more than twenty-one men learned in the law, who shall be appointed by the King; they must have the qualifications required by law for the* exercise of judicial functions, and shall, as judges, have shown knowledge, experience, and honesty. They shall be called councilors of justice and shall constitute the Supreme Court of the King. Their number shall not exceed twelve unless the King and the Riksdag should decide, in accordance with Art. 87, sec. 1, that the Supreme Court be divided into sections; in this case, the number of councilors of justice within the limits defined above, and the distribution of business between the sections shall be regulated in the same decree. ART. 18. The Supreme Court shall also receive and decide petitions asking that the King set aside judgments that have gained legal force or that he grant relief from forfeiture resulting from the expiration of a legal term. ART. 19. In case requests are made to the King by courts or officials regarding the proper interpretation of a law, the Supreme Court shall furnish such interpretation, if the matter is a proper one for the courts.

ART. 22. Cases of slight importance may be heard and decided in the Supreme Court by five members, and even by four, where all agree. In more important cases at least seven members shall take part in the judgment.

The offender shall then have the right to accept the pardon granted by the King or to suffer the punishment imposed upon him. ART. 26. When judicial affairs are laid before the Council of State two councilors of justice shall be present in addition to the head of the Department of Justice and two other members of the Council of State; it shall be their duty to enter their opinions in the minutes, as provided in Art. 9. .

MODERN CONSTITUTIONS

It shall be the principal duty of the attorney-general as the highest legal officer of the King, personally or through his subordinate officers, to prosecute, in the name of the King, all cases which affect the public safety or the rights of the crown; and also, on behalf of the King, to exercise supervision over the administration of justice, and in this capacity to prosecute offenses committed by judges or other officers. ART. 28. Sec. 1. The King1 in the Council of State shall have power to appoint and promote native Swedes to all offices and positions, high or low, within the kingdom, for which the King's commissions are granted; however, the proper authority shall first submit nominations, if such a practice has heretofore been customary. The King may, likewise, after having taken . the advice of the proper authorities or upon their nomination, appoint or promote foreigners of distinguished merit, professing the pure evangelical faith, to professorships in the universities excepting however the chairs of theology, to professorships or other positions in other institutions for science, manual training, or fine arts, and as physicians. The King may likewise employ foreigners of unusual ability in the military service, but not as commanders of fortresses. In all appointments the King shall consider only the candidate's merit and ability, and not his extraction. Only persons professing the pure evangelical faith shall be appointed to the office of preacher or to other offices carrying with them the obligation to give instruction in the Christian religion or in theology. To all other offices and positions, excepting membership in the Council of State as provided by Art. 4, persons belonging to another Christian faith or adherents of the Mosaic belief maybe appointed; however, no person not belonging to the pure evangelical faith shall take part, as judge or in any other position, in the discussion or decision of questions relating to divine worship, to religious instruction, or to appointments within the

Sec. 2. The King shall have power to confer Swedish nationality by means of naturalization, in the manner and upon the conditions to be determined by a special law passed in the manner provided by Art. 87, sec. 1. A naturalized foreigner shall enjoy the same rights and privileges as native-born Swedes except that he may not be appointed to membership in the Council of State. ART. 29. The King shall appoint the archbishop and bishops, one from a list of three candidates presented to him in the manner provided by the church law. ART. 30. The King shall, in the manner heretofore practiced, appoint the incumbents of the royal benefices. The socalled consistorial benefices shall retain their right of election. ART. 31.

SWEDEN

229

guished services, confer upon a noble the rank of baron, or upon a baron the rank of count. The rank of nobility and the titles of baron and count hereafter granted shall be borne only by the person ennobled or elevated in rank, and, after his death, descending lineally, by the eldest male heir of the oldest branch of his family and after its extinction, by the nearest male heir of the ancestor belonging to the oldest branch in existence, and so forth. If noble rank should pass by inheritance to a person who has already been ennobled or has received a title by previous inheritance, his own rank shall lapse, unless it is of a higher grade, in which case the lower rank shall go to the nearest branch of the family; if no such branch is in existence, the title shall become extinct. If anyone should forfeit his noble rank, the title shall go to the nearest heir, in accordance with the rules herein established. An ordinance regarding the nobility, to be adopted by the King in concert with the knights and nobles, shall prescribe the manner in which knights and nobles may assemble to decide upon matters which they have in common.

All dispatches and orders issued by the King, except in matters of military command, shall, in order to be valid, be signed by the King and bear the countersignature of the person presenting the matter, whose duty it shall be to see that the action taken is in agreement with the minutes made concerning it. The heads of departments may issue directly to proper parties instructions and memoranda regarding the execution of orders already given. Should the person presenting a matter think that any order of the King is in conflict with this constitution he shall make a representation to the Council of State concerning it; if the King should still insist upon issuing such order, it shall be the minister's right and duty to refuse his countersignature thereto and as a consequence to withdraw from his office, which he shall not resume until the Riksdag has examined and approved his conduct. In the meantime his salary and other emoluments shall continue.

23°

MODERN CONSTITUTIONS

ART. 39. Should the King desire to travel beyond Sweden and Norway he shall make known his intention at a full meeting of the Council of State and ask its opinion, as provided by Art. 9. Should the King decide to take such a trip and put his decision into execution he shall not take part in the government or exercise the royal power while he is outside the kingdom; but, during his absence, the government shall be conducted in the King's name by the heir apparent to the throne, if he has attained the age fixed by Art. 41. This prince shall govern as regent with all the royal power and authority, in accordance with this constitution; he shall not, however, confer ranks or titles of nobility, raise persons to the ranks of count or baron, or confer honorary orders; and all officers of trust appointed by the regent shall hold only by temporary appointment. If there should be no heir apparent, or if the nearest heir to the throne has not reached the age fixed by Art. 41, or if by illness or by absence from Sweden and Norway he is prevented from assuming the government, the Council of State shall govern with the same power as a regent. Art. 91 provides for the measures to be taken in case the King remains out of the kingdom for more than twelve months. ART. 40. Should the King become too ill to perform his functions the government shall be conducted in accordance with the preceding article. ART. 41. The King shall reach his majority at the age of eighteen. The same holds true for the heir apparent to the throne. Should the King die before the heir apparent has reached this age, the Council of State shall, in conformity with Art. 39, conduct the government in the name of the King, until the Riksdag convenes and until the regency established by it has entered upon its duties; the Council of State shall conform strictly to this constitution. ART. 42. If the misfortune should happen that the whole royal family, to which the succession belongs, becomes extinct in the male line, the Council of State shall also conduct the

SWEDEN

231

government, in conformity with Art. 39, until the Riksdag assembles and chooses a new royal house, and until the Kingelect assumes his function. ART. 43. When the King takes active part in a war, or when he visits distant parts of the kingdom or the kingdom of Norway, he shall designate three members of the Council of State, under a president separately appointed from among the princes of his house or from among the members of the Council of State, to conduct such matters of government as he may direct. Matters in which the King himself acts shall be conducted in accordance with Art. 8. The above provisions regarding the King shall also apply to the regent when he conducts the government. ART. 44. No prince of the royal house, whether crown prince, hereditary prince, or prince, shall marry without the King's knowledge and consent. Should he do so, he forfeits all hereditary right to the crown, for himself, his children, and his descendants. ART. 45. Neither the crown prince of Sweden, his heir apparent, nor the princes of the royal house shall hold any civil office or territorial rights of government; they may, however, according to ancient custom, bear the titles of duchies and principalities, without any rights over the territory of which they bear the name. ART. 46. The country shall remain divided into provinces under the customary provincial governments. No governorgeneral shall hereafter be appointed within the kingdom. ART. 47. The courts of appeal of the kingdom and all other courts shall decide cases in accordance with the laws. The administrative boards of the kingdom, provincial governments, and all other offices together with superior or inferior officers of the government shall perform their duties and functions in accordance with the instructions, regulations, and orders already issued or which may hereafter be issued; they shall obey all orders and commands of the King and assist one

232

MODERN CONSTITUTIONS

another in the execution of such orders and in the performance of all functions which the good of the kingdom may require of them, being responsible to the King, in accordance with the law, for any omission and negligence or for illegal actions. ART. 48. The King's court shall be under his own direction, and he may give orders regarding it, according to his own pleasure. He may, at will, appoint or dismiss all officials o < f his court. ART. 49. The Riksdag shall represent the Swedish people. All rights and duties now vested in the estates of the kingdom shall hereafter be vested in the Riksdag. The Riksdag shall be composed of two houses, whose members shall be chosen in the manner provided by the Riksdag law.2 The houses shall have equal power and authority in all matters. The Riksdag shall by virtue of this constitution, convene in regular session on the 15th of January of each year, or, if this day is a holiday, on the succeeding day; the King shall, however, have the power to call an extraordinary session of the Riksdag, in the intervals between its regular sessions.
By constitutional amendments of 1866 a legislature of two branches was substituted for the representation of the four estates. The Riksdag law of June 22, 1866, as amended to 1900, regulates the manner of election and the procedure of the two houses, which are placed upon a complete equality. The Riksdag meets annually and may remain in session for four months, but may be dissolved by the King at any time; however, new elections must be ordered immediately if the two houses or either of them is dissolved. The upper house is composed of one hundred and fifty members who are elected for a term of nine years; they are chosen indirectly by electoral bodies in the rural districts and in the cities not represented in the rural electoral bodies. Membership in the upper house is confined to persons thirty-five years of age who for three years prior to the election have owned taxable property valued at 80,000 rix-dollars or have paid taxes upon an annual income of at least 4,000 rix-dollars; a member ceasing to possess these qualifications loses his seat. Members of the upper house receive no salary. The members of the lower house are elected from single districts for a term of three years; of the two. hundred and thirty members, one hundred and fifty are chosen by the rural districts and eighty by the cities; in general the elections are indirect, but in the smaller towns and rural communes which are united for the election of a representative, elections may be

The extraordinary session of the Riksdag shall consider only the matters which occasioned its being called or other matters submitted to it by the King, and questions which may be inseparably connected with such matters. ART. 50. The Riksdag shall meet in the capital of the kingdom, except when invasion of an enemy, pestilence, or some other equally grave obstacle makes it impossible or dangerous to the liberty and security of the Riksdag. In such a case the King, after conferring with the persons elected by the Riksdag as commissioners of the state bank and of the office of the national debt, shall decide upon and announce another place of meeting. ART. 51. In case the Riksdag is convened by the King, regent, or Council of State the time of meeting fixed shall not be less than seven days nor more than twenty days after the summons is published in the general newspapers. ART. 52. The presidents and vice-presidents of the houses shall be appointed by the King. ART. 53. When in regular session, the Riksdag shall appoint the following committees for the preparation of busidirect if a majority of the qualified voters so desire. Persons qualified as municipal voters who pay taxes on an annual income of at least 800 rix-dollars, own real estate of a taxable value of at least 1,000 rix-dollars, or who have a leasehold interest for five years or for life of a taxable value of 6,ooo rix-dollars, may vote for members of the lower house; according to statistics of 1902 about 34 per cent, of the male population above the age of twentyone years possessed these qualifications. Qualified voters of twenty-five years of age may be elected from the districts within which they reside. Members of the lower house receive traveling expenses, and a compensation of 1,200 rix-dollars for each regular session; for extraordinary sessions they receive a per diem. On May 14, 1907, a law was passed introducing universal male suffrage for the election of members of the lower house of the Riksdag, and reducing the property qualification of members of the upper house to 50,000 kroner or to the payment of a tax on an annual income of 3,000 kroner. As a fundamental law this measure must be passed at two successive sessions of the Riksdag, but its passage is assured. This is one of the most important steps yet taken in Sweden toward democratic government, and is comparable with the parliamentary reform of 1866.

ness: a Constitutional Committee to raise and consider questions regarding changes in the fundamental laws and to report thereon to the Riksdag, and also to examine the minutes kept by the Council of State; a Committee of Finance to examine and to report to the Riksdag upon the condition, administration, and needs of the public treasury and of the office of the national debt; an Appropriation Committee to consider questions of appropriations; a Committee on the Bank to superintend the management and condition of the bank and to give directions regarding its administration; and a Committee on Laws, to elaborate projects submitted to it by the houses for the improvement of the civil, criminal, municipal, and ecclesiastical laws. At the extraordinary sessions of the Riksdag no more committees shall be appointed than are necessary for the preparation of the measures to be considered. ART. 54. Should the King ask that special delegates of the Riksdag consult with him upon matters which he thinks should be kept secret, such delegates shall be chosen by the houses; however, they shall have no power to make decisions, but shall merely advise the King with regard to the measures submitted for their consideration. The delegates shall take an oath of secrecy if required to do so by the King. ART. 55. Neither the Riksdag, its houses, nor any of its committees shall deliberate or decide upon any matter in the presence of the King. ART. 56. The Riksdag law shall determine the order of proceeding with reference to propositions of the King and with reference to questions raised by members of the houses. ART. 57. The ancient right of the Swedish people to tax themselves shall be exercised by the Riksdag alone. The municipal laws, to be enacted by the King and Riksdag acting together, shall determine the manner in which the separate areas of local government may tax themselves for their own needs.

The Riksdag law shall determine how the Riksdag shall proceed in the consideration of the reports of the Committee of Finance with reference to the estabfishment of the budget, to the whole appropriation necessary to meet the requirements of the budget, to the expenses and revenues of the office of the public debt, or to the principles of its administration. Should the houses reach different conclusions which cannot be brought into agreement, each house shall vote separately upon the matter in dispute; the opinion which receives the majority of the votes of the two houses shall be the decision of the Riksdag. ART. 70. When the two houses disagree with regard to regulations for the national bank, as to its receipts and expenses, or as to relieving the bank commissioners from their responsibility in cases of supposed misdemeanor, each house shall vote separately as provided in the preceding article. ART. 71. The same procedure shall also be followed when the houses do not agree upon the principles of an appropriation or upon the manner of its application or payment. ART. 72. The national bank shall remain under the guaranty of the Riksdag, and shall be administered by commissioners appointed for this purpose, in accordance with a law agreed upon between the King and the Riksdag. The commissioners shall be seven in number, one of whom the King shall appoint for three years; the King shall also name one deputy commissioner; the other six commissioners and three deputies shall be chosen by the Riksdag for the term and in the manner prescribed by the Riksdag law. The regular member appointed by the King shall preside over the commissioners, but shall perform no other duties in the administration of the bank.

NO new imposition of taxes, compulsory enrolment of troops, nor levy of money or of goods shall hereafter be ordered, demanded, or executed without the free will and consent of the Riksdag, in the manner provided above. ART. 74. From the day when, by decision of the King in Council after summoning the Riksdag to convene, the forces of the kingdom are placed upon a war footing, either for the preservation of the neutrality of the kingdom when, in case of war between foreign powers, such neutrality is threatened or violated by any of the belligerent powers or for defense against an imminent or actual attack, until the return to a peace footing, the King shall have power, upon the credit of the state, in the manner and under the conditions prescribed by a special law to be agreed upon between the King and the Riksdag, to make requisitions upon communities or individuals for such supplies and services as may be furnished by the locality, as are indispensably necessary to meet the needs of the army, and which cannot be provided for with sufficient promptness in any other manner. ART. 75. The annual table of market rates shall be prepared by persons chosen in the manner specially provided by the Riksdag; such table shall be followed until its modification is sought and obtained in the regular manner. ART. y6. The King shall not, without the consent of the Riksdag, contract loans at home or abroad or burden the kingdom with new debts. ART. yy.

ART. 78. No part of the kingdom may be disposed of by sale, mortgage, gift, or in any other similar manner. ART. 79. Sec. 1. No change shall be made in the arms or flag of the kingdom without the consent of the Riksdag. Sec. 2. Nor shall any change be made in the standard or weight of the money of the kingdom, either to increase or to decrease it, without the consent of the Riksdag; however, the King's right to coin money shall remain undisturbed. ART. 80. The recruiting of the land and naval forces shall remain under the system of equipment duty and military tenure based upon the contracts and agreements to supply troops made with the towns and rural districts; this system shall not be altered in its fundamental principles until the King and the Riksdag agree upon the necessity of some change. No new or increased obligations to furnish recruits shall be imposed except by agreement between the King and the Riksdag. Should a special law abolish the military tenure system and establish some other principle for the organization of the land and naval forces, no change shall be made in such law except by agreement between the King and the Riksdag.3
Until recent years the Swedish standing army was based largely upon what were called the rotering and indelning systems. By rotering was meant the obligation of certain proprietors of land to furnish and maintain foot soldiers or seamen, usually in return for exemption from forced enlistment. Under the indelning system lands were assigned upon condition that they should furnish and support mounted troops, or provinces agreed to furnish a certain number of such troops in return for a reduction of taxes or of rents due - to the state. It has been the policy of the government for some time to abolish these systems; by law of June 14, 1901, universal compulsory military service was introduced, and by 1913 the old standing army will have entirely disappeared.

MODERN CONSTITUTIONS

ART. 81. This constitution and the other fundamental laws shall not be altered or repealed except by resolution of the King and of two' regular sessions of the Riksdag. The decision of the Riksdag upon a proposal made by the King with reference to a fundamental law shall be communicated to him in the manner prescribed by the Riksdag law. If the Riksdag should adopt such a proposal made within its own body, its decision thereon shall be submitted to the King. In the latter case the King, before the adjournment of the Riksdag, shall take the advice of the Council of State in full session and shall, in the hall of state, inform the Riksdag of his consent or of his reasons for not approving its resolution. ART. 82. Amendments to the fundamental laws adopted by the Riksdag and approved by the King or proposed by the King and adopted by the Riksdag, in the prescribed manner, shall have force as fundamental law. ART. 83. No interpretation of the fundamental laws to hold good for the future shall be valid unless adopted in the manner provided for amending such laws. ART. 84. The fundamental laws shall be applied literally in each particular case. ART. 85. The following shall be considered fundamental laws: this constitution, the Riksdag law, the act of succession, and the law relating to the freedom of the press which shall be adopted by agreement between the King and the Riksdag in accordance with the principles established by this constitution. ART. 86. By freedom of the press is understood the right of every Swede to publish his writings without any previous interference on the part of public officials; the individual may afterward be prosecuted before a regular court because of the contents of his publication, but shall not be punished unless such publication is plainly in conflict with a law enacted to preserve the public peace, without interfering with public instruction.

relating to foreign affairs and to matters of military command, shall be published without restriction; the minutes and proceedings of the national bank and of the office of the national debt, concerning matters which should be kept secret, shall not be published. ART. 87. Sec. 1. The Riksdag shall have power, in concert with the King, to enact civil and criminal laws and criminal laws for the army, and to amend or repeal any laws now in force. Neither the King without the approval of the Riksdag nor the Riksdag without the consent of the King shall have power to enact new laws or to repeal old ones. Proposals may be made in either house, and shall be decided upon by the Riksdag after the committee on laws has reported upon them. If the Riksdag decides to adopt a new law or to amend or repeal an old one, its project shall be submitted to the King, who shall consult the Council of State and the Supreme Court regarding it, and after having reached a decision shall inform the Riksdag of his consent to its proposal or of his reasons for refusing consent. Should the King not be able to make or announce his decision before the adjournment of the Riksdag he may, before the opening of the next session, approve the measure exactly as passed by the Riksdag, and make known his decision. Otherwise the proposal shall be regarded as rejected, and the King shall inform the Riksdag, at its next session, of the reasons which prevented his approving, the measure. If the King wishes to propose a bill to the Riksdag, he shall obtain the opinion of the Council of State and of the Supreme Court regarding the matter and shall present his proposal, together with such opinions, to the Riksdag; the Riksdag shall then proceed with the proposal according to the Riksdag law. Sec. 2. The Riksdag shall also have power, in concert with the King, to enact, amend, or repeal laws relating to the church, but the consent of a general church council shall also be necessary. When a law upon this subject is proposed by the King, the opinions of the Council of State and of the •

242

MODERN CONSTITUTIONS

Supreme Court shall be obtained and submitted to the Riksdag with the proposal, in the manner provided by sec. I of this article. If the project in question has not been promulgated as law before the opening of the first session following that in which it was proposed and adopted, it shall be considered rejected and the King shall inform the Riksdag of the reasons which prevented his approving the measure. ART. 88. With reference to the interpretation of civil, criminal, or church laws the same procedure shall be followed as in the passage of such laws. Interpretations which the King may give through the Supreme Court, during the recess of the Riksdag, in answer to questions regarding the true meaning of a law, may be overruled by the Riksdag at its next session; or if the interpretation related to a church law, it may be overruled by the first general church council meeting after its publication. The interpretations which have thus been overruled shall lose their validity and shall not be observed or relied upon by the courts. ART. 89. Projects regarding the amendment, interpretation, or repeal of laws and decrees relating to the general economy of the kingdom, new laws of this character, and proposals concerning the principles to be followed in all branches of the public administration, may be introduced in the houses of the Riksdag. In such matters, however, the Riksdag shall merely present an address to the King expressing its wishes and opinions; the King, after consulting the Council of State, shall take such action as he considers most beneficial to the kingdom. If the King wishes to consider with the Riksdag any matters relating to the general administration of the country, the procedure shall be the same as that prescribed in sec. 1 of Art. 87 for the consideration of laws. ART. 90. Questions relating to the appointment and removal of officers, to decisions, decrees, or judgments of the government or of the courts, to the conduct of individuals or corporations, or to the execution of any law, decree, or under-

SWEDEN

243

taking shall in no case or manner be subjett to consideration or investigation by the Riksdag, by its houses, or by its committees, except as literally prescribed by the fundamental laws. ART. 91. When the King, in the case referred to in Art. 39, visiting abroad, shall remain out of the kingdom for more than twelve months, the regent, or the Council of State, if the latter is in charge of the government, shall summon the Riksdag by public proclamation, such summons to be published in the general newspapers within fifteen days after the expiration of the twelve months. The King shall be notified of this action, and if he still remains out of the kingdom, the Riksdag shall take such action as it thinks most proper regarding the government of the country. ART. 92. The same procedure shall be followed, if illness 0'f the King should prevent his performing the duties of his office for more than twelve months. ART. 93. If the King should die when the heir apparent is under age, the Council of State shall summon the Riksdag, such summons to be published within fifteen days after the death of the King. The Riksdag shall have power, without regard to anything in the deceased King's will regarding the . government, to establish a regency of one, three, or five persons, who shall conduct the government in the King's name, in accordance with this constitution, until the King becomes of age. ART. 94. Should the unfortunate event occur that the royal family having the right of succession to the throne becomes extinct in the male line, the Council of State shall, within the period after the last King's death fixed by the preceding article, convene the Riksdag, which shall choose a new royal house, always maintaining this constitution. ART. 95. If unexpectedly the regent or the Council of State should fail to summon the Riksdag immediately, in the cases mentioned in the four preceding articles, it shall be the absolute duty of the courts of appeal of the kingdom publicly

244

MODERN CONSTITUTIONS

to make known such fact, in order that the Riksdag may convene to protect its own rights and the rights of the country. In such a case the Riksdag shall assemble on the twentieth day after the latest date on which the regent or the Council of State should have issued its summons. ART. 96. The Riksdag shall at each regular session appoint as its attorney a person of known legal ability and of proved honesty; it shall be his duty, in accordance with instructions given him by the Riksdag, to have oversight of the execution of the law by judges and officers, and also to prosecute before the proper courts persons who, because of favoritism or for any other reasons, have acted unlawfully or who have neglected properly to perform their official duties. This officer shall, however, be subject to the same responsibilities and penalties as are provided for public prosecutors by general laws and by the laws of procedure. ART. 97. This solicitor-general of the Riksdag, who during his term of office shall in every respect have the same rank as the King's attorney-general, shall be chosen in the manner provided by the Riksdag law; another person with the same qualifications shall be chosen at the same time to take the place of the solicitor-general should he die before his successor is elected at the next regular session of the Riksdag, and to perform the duties of solicitor-general in case that officer is prevented from exercising his functions by serious illness or by other cause. ART. 98. If the solicitor-general resigns from his office or dies during the session of the Riksdag, the Riksdag shall immediately appoint in his place the person who had been chosen as his substitute. Should the substitute resign from his position, be appointed solicitor-general, or die during the session, another qualified person shall be chosen in his place, in the manner provided above. Should a vacancy in either of these positions occur during the recess of the Riksdag, the powers of that body with regard to them shall be exercised by the

The solicitor-general may, whenever he pleases, attend the sessions of the Supreme Court, of the office of judicial affairs, of the courts of appeal, of the administrative boards or of the institutions established in their place, and of all the lower courts, but without the right to take part in their proceedings; he shall also have access to the minutes and records of all courts, administrative boards, and public offices. The King's officers are in general bound to assist the solicitorgeneral, and all public prosecutors shall aid him in the conduct of cases, if he asks for their assistance. ART. 100. The solicitor-general shall present to' each regular session of the Riksdag a report of the administration of his office, in which he shall give an account of the administration of justice in the kingdom, call attention to defects in the laws and decrees, and make suggestions for their improvement. ART. 101. In case of the unexpected event that the entire Supreme Court or one or more of its members, because of selfinterest, partiality, or negligence, shall have rendered such an unjust judgment, in conflict with clear law and with the evidence, that it causes or might have caused loss of life, of personal liberty, of honor, or of property, it shall be the duty of the solicitor-general and shall be within the power of the King's attorney-general to bring charges against the offender before the court provided below and to prosecute him in accordance with the law of the land. ART. 102. In this case the court, to be known as the Court of Impeachment, shall be composed of the president of the Svea4 Court of Appeals, who shall preside, of the presidents of „ all of the administrative boards of the kingdom, of the

four senior members of the Council of State, of the highest officer in command of troops stationed at the capital, of the highest naval officer in command of the fleet stationed at the capital, of the two senior members of the Svea Court of Appeals, and of the senior member of each of the administrative boards of the kingdom. When either the attorney-general or the solicitor-general thinks himself justified in accusing the entire Supreme Court or any of its members he shall ask the president of the Svea Court of Appeals, as president of the Court of Impeachment, to issue a summons in legal form to the person or persons to be prosecuted. The president of the Court of Appeals shall then take steps to convene the Court of Impeachment in order that it may issue the summons and further deal with'the case according to law. Should he unexpectedly fail to do this or should any of the above-mentioned officers refuse to act in the Court of Impeachment they shall be legally responsible for such intentional neglect of their official duty. If one or more members of the Court of Impeachment have a lawful excuse or if he is properly challenged as incompetent to act, the court shall still be qualified, if it consists of twelve persons. If the president of the Court of Appeals has a lawful excuse or is challenged, the oldest of the remaining presidents shall take his place. After having tried the case and reached a lawful decision, the court shall pronounce its judgment in public session. No one shall have power to change this judgment; the King, however, may grant pardon, which shall not extend to a reinstatement of the sentenced person in the service of the country. ART. 103. Every third year the Riksdag shall in regular session, in the manner provided by the Riksdag law, appoint a commission whose duty it shall be to decide if all of the members of the Supreme Court deserve to be retained in their important offices, or if any of them1 ought to be deprived of the exercise of the judicial power, without having clearly committed the errors or crimes referred to in the preceding article.

Should this commission, after voting* in the manner prescribed by the Riksdag law, decide that one or more of the members of the Supreme Court are undeserving of the confidence of the Riksdag, the person or persons in question shall be honorably discharged from their offices by the King, to whom the Riksdag shall report its decision. The King shall, however, grant to each such person an annual pension amounting to one-half of his salary. ART. 104. The Riksdag shall not take under special examination any decision of the Supreme Court, nor shall such a decision be a subject for general consideration before the commission provided above. ART. 105. The Constitutional Committee of a regular session of the Riksdag shall have power to ask for the minutes kept by the Council of State, except those which relate to foreign affairs or to matters of military command, which may be demanded only in case of matters already generally known and by specific request of the committee. ART. 106. If the committee discovers, from these minutes, that any member of the Council of State, any person assigned to lay a report before the King, or the officer advising the King in military affairs, has clearly acted in violation of the constitution or of general laws, or has recommended such violation or has omitted to protest against it, or has occasioned or encouraged it by wilful concealment of any information, or that the person presenting a report has failed to refuse his countersignature to the decision of the King, in the cases specified by Art. 38 of this constitution, then the Constitutional Committee shall, through the solicitor-general of the Riksdag, bring charges against such person before the Court of Impeachment, in which, for such cases, the four senior councilors of justice shall take the place of the members of the Council of State; otherwise the procedure shall be as provided by Arts. 101 and 102 for the impeachment of the Supreme Court. When members of the Council of State or the advisers of the

248

•

MODERN CONSTITUTIONS

King in military affairs are found to be guilty in the manner provided above, the Court of Impeachment shall sentence them in accordance with general law and with a special law to be enacted by the King and the Riksdag regarding their responsibility. ART. 107. Should the Constitutional Committee notice that all of the members of the Council of State or any of them, in their advice upon public measures, have not had due regard to the true welfare of the state, or that any person presenting matters to the King has failed to perform his duties with impartiality, zeal, ability, and energy, the committee shall lay the matter before the Riksdag, which, if it thinks the welfare of the country requires it, may inform the King in writing that it desires the removal from the Council of State or from office of the person or persons who have incurred its censure. Motions of this character may also be made in the houses of the Riksdag by other committees, but no decision shall be reached by the Riksdag until after the Constitutional Committee has been heard. In the consideration of such matters by the Riksdag, decisions of the King with reference to the rights or affairs of individuals or corporations shall not even be mentioned, much less shall they be made the subject of any investigation by the Riksdag. Everything that the Riksdag, after investigation, shall have approved or left uncensured shall be regarded as relieved from responsibility, and no new investigation of the same matter shall be undertaken by another Riksdag for the purpose of fixing liability; however, in addition to the general supervision of the administration of public funds exercised by the committee or auditors of the Riksdag, it shall be the duty of the proper officers to conduct such special audits as pertain to their official duties. ART. 108. Every third year the Riksdag in regular session shall, in the manner prescribed by the Riksdag law, appoint six persons of known intelligence and knowledge, who

These commissioners, of whom two in addition to the solicitor-general shall be lawyers, shall have the following duty: In case an author or printer, before publishing, submits a manuscript to them and asks their advice as to whether it would be subject to an action under the law relating to the freedom of the press, the solicitor-general and not less than three of the commissioners, of whom one shall be a lawyer, shall state their opinion in writing. If they decide that the manuscript may be printed, both author and publisher shall be free from all responsibility, but the commissioners shall be responsible. ART. 109. The regular session of the Riksdag shall not be adjourned, without its own consent, until after a period of four months, unless the King, in accordance with the provisions of the Riksdag law, orders a new election of one or both houses, in which case the Riksdag shall reassemble, within three months after the dissolution, upon the date set by the King, and preserving its character as a regular session, shall not again be adjourned until after four months from the date of its last assembling. The King may close an extraordinary session of the Riksdag whenever he thinks best, and shall always close it before the time fixed for the meeting of the regular session. If the unexpected event should happen that the Riksdag, at the close of its session shall not have established the budget nor granted any new general supplies, the former budget and appropriations shall remain in force until the next session. If, however, the total appropriation had been fixed, but the houses disagree as to its distribution, the articles of the last appropriation law shall be increased or decreased in the proportion of such total appropriation to the appropriation voted by the preceding session, and the Riksdag shall intrust the preparation of the budget on these principles to the commissioners of the

No member of the Riksdag shall be prosecuted or arrested on account of his actions or utterances in that body unless the house to which he belongs has authorized such prosecution or arrest, by special resolution adopted by at least a five-sixths vote. No member of the Riksdag shall be banished from the place where it meets. Should any individual or body, civil or military, or any multitude of whatever name, either spontaneously or under direction of others, attempt injury to the Riksdag, its houses, its committees, or to any one of its members, or to disturb the freedom of its discussions and decisions, such actions shall be considered as treason, and the Riksdag may prosecute the offenders in accordance with law. If a member of the Riksdag, during a session or when going to or from a session, is molested by word or action, the offender being aware of his errand, the offense shall be dealt with according to the general law with reference to assaults upon or insults to the King's officers. The same law shall apply to assaults upon or insults to the commissioners, auditors, or solicitor-general of the Riksdag, to the secretaries or officers of either house, or of any of their committees, during or in consequence of the performance of their duties. • ART. H I . If a member of the Riksdag is accused of a serious offense he shall not be arrested until the judge, after investigation, considers such arrest justifiable, provided that he was not caught in the act; however, if he does not obey the summons of the court, he shall be dealt with according to the provisions of the general laws. No member of the Riksdag shall be deprived of his liberty except in the cases mentioned in this and in the preceding article. The commissioners of the national bank and of the office of the public debt and the auditors of the Riksdag shall receive no orders relating to their duties except from the Riksdag or

Assessors whose duty it is, on behalf of the Riksdag, to apply the provisions of the appropriation law shall not be held liable because of the performance of their duties. ART. 114. ' The ancient privileges, advantages, rights, and liberties of the estates o<f the kingdom shall remain in force, except where they are indissolubly connected with the right of representation formerly belonging to the estates and have consequently ceased to exist with the abolition of that right. The rights of the estates shall not be altered or annulled except by agreement between the King and the Riksdag, and with the consent of the nobility if their privileges are in question or of a general church council if the privileges of the clergy are affected.
