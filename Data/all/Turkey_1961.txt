The Grand National Assembly is empowered to enact, amend and repeal laws, to debate and adopt the bills on the State budget and final accounts, to pass resolutions in regard to minting currency, proclaiming pardons and amnesties, and to the carrying out of definitive death sentences passed by courts.

The ratification of treaties negotiated with foreign States and international organizations in behalf of the Turkish Republic is dependent upon approval of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and such ratification can be finalized only through the enactment of a law by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. Treaties which regulate economic, commercial and technical relations, and which are not effective for a period longer than one year, may be put into effect through promulgation, provided they do not entail a commitment of the State's finances and provided they do not infringe upon the status of individuals or upon the rights of ownership of Turkish

Turkey	

1167

citizens in foreign lands. In such cases, these treaties must be brought to the attention of the Turkish Grand National Assembly within two months following their promulgation. Agreements concluded in connection with the implementation of an international treaty, and economic, commercial, technical or administrative treaties concluded pursuant to the authority provided by laws are not required to be approved by the Turkish Grand National Assembly provided however that economic and commercial treaties or treaties affecting the rights of individuals shall not be put into effect unless promulgated. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply in all treaties involving amendments in Turkish legislation. International treaties duly put into effect carry the force of law. No recourse to the Constitutional Court can be made as provided in'Articles 149 and 151 with regard to these treaties. Art. 66. The authority to declare a state of war in cases deemed legitimate by international law, and exclusive of cases rendered necessary by international treaties to which Turkey is a party, or by rules of international comity, to send Turkish expeditionary forces to foreign lands and to allow foreign armed forces to be stationed in Turkey, is vested in the Turkish Grand National Assembly. For the granting of such permission the National Assembly and the Senate shall pass resolutions in joint session. Art. 67. The National Assembly is composed of 450 deputies elected by direct general ballot. Art. 68. Every Turk who has completed his thirtieth year is eligible to be elected deputy. Persons who are illiterate, under interdiction, those who have not done or those who are not considered to have done their active military service despite the fact that they are liable for and not exempted from such service, those who are barred from public service, those who have been convicted by final judgment to a term of penal servitude or who have been sentenced to five years imprisonment, except in cases of conviction for negligence, or those who have been sentenced by final judgment for any offense such as defalcation, misappropriation, embezzlement, bribery, theft, fraud, forgery, breach of confidence, and those who have been convicted of such disgraceful offenses as fraudulent bankruptcy are not eligible for election as deputies, even though they may have been pardoned. Placing one's candidacy shall not be made dependent upon resignation from public service. To ensure that elections are conducted safely, provision shall be made in the law as to which public servants may place their candidacy and under what conditions. Judges, army officers, military employees and non-commissioned officers are not entitled to place their candidacy or to be elected unless they resign from office.

At least ten of such members shall be appointed from among persons who are not members of any political party. Art. 73. The term of office of Senate members is six years. Members completing their term of office are eligible for re-election. One third of the Senate members elected by general ballot and by the President of the Republic shall be rotated every two years.

The person appointed to fill a vacancy shall be appointed for the remainder of the term of office of the member he replaces. Art. 74.

B. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO BOTH LEGISLATIVE BODIES

Art. 76. Members of the Grand National Assembly represent neither their constituencies nor their constituents, but the nation as a whole. Art. 77. The members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey shall take the following oath at their induction into office: "I swear upon my honor that I will protect the independence of the State, and the integrity of the homeland and the nation, that I will remain committed to the unqualified and unconditional sovereignty of the nation, and to the principles of a democratic and secular republic, and that I will make every effort to promote the happiness of the people." Art. 78. No person may become a member of both legislative bodies. Members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly may not be employed by any governmental department or other public corporate bodies nor enterprises and corporations in which the State or other corporate bodies participate directly or indirectly, nor may they hold positions in the administrative boards and in other public welfare societies of which the private sources of income and special facilities are provided by law, and

1170	

Turkey

neither may they directly or indirectly undertake any of their activities. Members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly may not be charged with any official or private responsibility which entails proposals, recommendations, appointments, or approval by the Executive branch.

No member of the legislative body, who is alleged to have committed an offense before or after his election to office may be taken into custody, questioned, held in custody nor brought to trial without the decision of the legislative body to which he belongs. This provision does not apply to cases where the accused was apprehended in flagrance delicto which entail heavy penalties; provided, however, that in such instances the competent authority is under obligation to inform directly and forthwith particular legislative body to which the member belongs. The execution of a criminal sentence passed against a member of the legislative body before or after his election, is suspended until his membership expires. Prescription does not operate for the duration of his term of office.

Political party groups in the legislative bodies shall not hold debates and pass resolutions in connection with legislative immunities. Art. 80. A member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly shall be disfranchised in cases of final conviction rendered by a competent court for an offense preventing his election as a member and in cases where he resigns, is interdicted, accepts a duty incompatible with his status as a member, or when the legislative body to which he belongs decides to disfranchise him for failure to attend the functions of the Assembly for a consecutive period of one month without taking leave or without offering an acceptable reason for his absence. Art. 81.
