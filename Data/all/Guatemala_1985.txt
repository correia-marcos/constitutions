Article 153.--The Rule of Law. The rule of law extends to all individuals who live on the territory of the Republic. Article 154.--Public Function; Subjection to the Law.

Deputies are representatives of the people and dignitaries of the Nation.' As a guarantee for the exercise of their functions they will enjoy, from the day they declare themselves elected, the following prerogatives:.

Only the Congress will be competent to judge and determine if there has been arbitrariness or "ultra vires" behavior and to impose the appropriate disciplinary sanctions. Considering the declaration to which paragraph (a) in this article refers, those accused are subject to the jurisdiction of the competent judge.

The election of a deputy is void if he was an official exercising jurisdiction in the electoral district for which he was a candidate or if he had exercised jurisdiction three months prior to the date on which the election was held.
