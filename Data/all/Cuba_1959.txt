FUNDAMENTAL LAW TITLE FIRST The Nation, its Territory and Form of Government Article 1. Cuba is an independent and sovereign State, organized as a unitary and democratic republic, for the enjoyment of political liberty; social j u s t i c e , individual and collective welfare, and human solidarity. Article 2, Sovereignty r e s t s in the people, and from the people all public powers emanate. Article 3. The t e r r i t o r y of the Republic is composed of the Island of Cuba, the Isle of Pines,, and all other adjacent islands and keys which with them were under the sovereignty of Spain until the ratification of the Treaty of P a r i s of December 10, 1398. The Republic shall not conclude or ratify any pacts or treaties which in any manner limit or diminish the national sovereignty or t e r r i t o r i a l integrity.

Article 4. The territory of the Repr.biic is divided into provinces and these latter into municipal districts. The provinces at the present time are Pinar del Rio, La Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camaguey, and Oriente. Article 5. The flag of the Republic is that of Narciso Lopez, which was raised on the fortress of El Morro at Havana on May 20, 1902, when the public powers were transmitted to the people of Cuba. The national coat of arms is the one established as such by law. The Republic shall not recognize or consecrate as having a national character any flag, anthem, or coat of arms other than those to which this article r e f e r s . On buildings, forts, and public offices and in official acts no other than the national flag shall be raised, except foreign flags in those c a s e s and in the manner permitted by protocol and by international usage, treaties, and the laws. As an exception, the flag of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes may be raised in the city of Bayamo, which is declared a national monument. The national anthem is the Hymn of Bayamo, composed by Pedro Figueredo, and it shall be the only one played in all government offices, barracks, and official acts. Foreign anthems may be played in the c a s e s previously specified in connection with foreign flags. Notwithstanding what is provided in the second paragraph of this article, societies, organizations, or associations of any kind may raise their flags or insignia on their buildings, but the national flag shall always occupy a preferential place. Article 6. The official language of the Republic is Spanish.

Article 7. Cuba condemns w a r s of aggression; it a s p i r e s to live in peace with all other states and to maintain cultural and c o m m e r c i a l r e l a tions and ties with them. The Cuban State adopts the principles and p r a c t i c e s of i n t e r n a t i o n a l law which favor human solidarity, r e s p e c t for the sovereignty of peoples, reciprocity between nations, and u n i v e r s a l peace and civilization.

Those who commit these crimes shall be subject to the penalties and qualifications imposed by the law in force at the time of the offense. In cases of crimes committed in the service of the tyranny overthrown on December 31, 1958, the perpetrators may be tried in accordance with penal laws promulgated for this purpose. Article 22. No other laws shall have retroactive effect, unless the law itself so specifies for reasons of public order, of social utility, or national necessity, expressly stated in the law, approved by a vote of two thirds of the total number of members of the Council of Minister? If the grounds for retroactivity are impugned as unconstitutional, the Court of Constitutional and Social Guarantees shall decide thereon, and it cannot for technical reasons or any other motive whatever, refrain from doing so. In every case, the law itself must establish the degree, manner, and form in which indemnity shall be paid for damages, if any, which thy retroactivity causes to rights legitimately acquired in accordance with previous legislation. A law approved in accordance with this article shall not be valid if it produces effects contrary to the provisions of Article 24 of this Fundamental Law. Article 23.

c) The amounts applicable to i n t e r e s t , or to principal as the case may be, shall be prorated among the various c r e d i t o r s , if n e c e s s a r y , in accordance with the amountswhich they are respectively entitled to receive in compliance with the p r e s e n t t r a n s i t o r y provision. d) Whenever in any harvest the official average price reaches 2 cents or more per pound, five percent of the value of the sugar produced in that harvest anc. pertaining to the mill, that i s , excluding the sugar necessary to pay the price of the cane ground, shall be applied as a special amortization for the year in question, and ten percent additional in lieu of the five •percent when the price exceeds 2.50 cents, without such special amortizations eliminating the obligation of the collectible a m o r tization that the debtor must pay. e) On expiration of the period specified by Rule F i r s t , the creditor shall be entitled to claim all that is due him for principal and i n t e r e s t collectible in accordance with this t r a n sitory provision. Fourth: With r e s p e c t to obligations proceeding or derived from the d e f e r r e d price of lots bought on installments, p r i o r to August 15, 1934, r e g a r d l e s s of the principal due, the a m o r t i zation shall be effected in thirty y e a r s , as an exception to the provisions regarding these points in Rules F i r s t and Second, which shall be applicable in all other c a s e s , and in no case shall i n t e r e s t be paid. This rule shall be applied only to lots the deferred p r i c e of which does not exceed 3,000 pesos. In the event of judicial sale because of failure to pay the p r i c e of a lot sold on installments, the value of the buildings constructed thereon by the purchaser or his s u c c e s s o r s shall be appraised in the judicial proceedings, deducting from the amount fixed the value that reasonably r e p r e s e n t s the use and enjoyment of the said buildings. The net amount resulting from the appraisal thus made shall he paid to the debtor by the p u r c h a s e r at the sale or by the creditor, as the case may be, as indemnity, before ownership of the property is conveyed to him.
