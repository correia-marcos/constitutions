CONSTITUTION of GREECE'
January 1, 1952 In the name of the Holy, Consubstantial and Indivisible Trinity. THE PARLIAMENT OF THE HELLENES, RESOLVES Religion
Art. 1. The established religion in Greece is that of the Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ; every other known religion is free, and the forms of worship thereof shall be practiced without hindrance under the protection of the laws; proselytism and all other interferences with the established religion being prohibited. Art. 2. The Orthodox Church of Greece, acknowledging as its head our Lord Jesus Christ, is indissolubly united in doctrine with the Great Church of Constantinople and every other Church of Christ of the same doctrine, observing steadfastly, as they do, the holy apostolic and synodical canons and holy traditions; it is autocephalous, exercising its sovereign rights independently of every other Church, and it is administered by a Holy Synod of bishops. The ministers of all recognized religions shall be subject to the same superintendence on the part of the State as the ministers of the established religion. The text of the Holy Scriptures shall be maintained unchanged; the rendering thereof into a different linguistic form without the previous sanction of autocephalous the Church of Greece and the Great Church of Christ in Constantinople is absolutely prohibited. The freedom of religious conscience is inviolable. The free exercise of religious duties shall not be permitted to offend public order or good morals.

Art. 3. Greeks are equal before the law. Greek citizens shall contribute without discrimination towards meeting the public expenditure according to their ability. Only Greek citizens shall be admissible to all public appointments, save in those cases where exceptions are introduced by special laws. Citizens are those who have acquired or shall acquire the qualifications of citizenship in accordance with the laws of the State Titles of nobility or distinction are neither conferred upon nor recognized in Greek citizens. Every Greek able to bear arms is obliged to assist in the defense of the country as provided by the laws. Art. 4. Personal liberty is inviolable; no one shall be prosecuted, arrested, imprisoned or otherwise confined, except when and as the law provides. Art. 5. With the exception of persons taken in the act of the committing an offense, no one shall be arrested or imprisoned without a judicial warrant stating the reasons which must be served at the moment of arrest or imprisonment pending trial. Any person taken in the act or arrested on the basis of a warrant of arrest shall without delay be brought before the competent examining magistrate within twenty four hours of his arrest at the latest, or, if the arrest was made beyond the seat of the examining magistrate, within the time absolutety necessary for his conveyance. Within at the most three days from such appearance, the examining magistrate must either release the person arrested or deliver a warrant for his imprisonment. This time limit shall be extended for up to five days at the request of the person arrested or in the event of force majeure, which shall be certified forthwith by a decision of the competent judicial council. Should both these time limits expire without such action, every jailer or other officer, civil or military, charged with the detention of the person arrested shall release him forthwith. Transgressors of the above provisions shall be punished for illegal confinement and shall be obliged to make good any loss sustained by the injured party and further to give satisfaction to said party by such sum of money as the law provides. The maximum term of imprisonment pending trial, as well as the con-

Greece

405

ditions under which the State shall indemnify persons unjustly imprisoned pending trial or sentence, shall be determined by law. Art. 6. In the case of political offenses, the court of misdemeanors may always, on the request of the person detained, allow his release on bail fixed by a judicial order, which shall admit of appeal. In the case of such offenses, imprisonment pending trial shall under no circumstances be extended beyond three months. Interpretative Clause The introduction in the future of general or special laws abolishing or restricting the term of imprisonment pending trial or rendering release on bail mandatory for the judge is by no means precluded. It is further understood that the maximum term of three months set in the second paragraph for imprisonment pending trial shall include the duration of both the entire investigation and the procedure before the judicial councils prior to the final hearing. Art. 7. No offense shall exist, nor shall any punishment be imposed, unless a law existed prior to commission of the act. A heavier punishment shall never be imposed after commission of the act.

Only after the final decision of the authority to whom the petition was made, and with the permission thereof, may action be initiated to determine responsibility of the petitioner for offenses which may be contained in the petition. Interpretative Clause. By petition is meant recourse to a competent authority and not a request for information which, each authority is, in any case, morally obliged to furnish. Art. 10. Greeks have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. The police may be present only at public gatherings.

Only the publisher of the item seized shall be allowed to appeal against the judicial order. After at least three convictions of a press offense which admits of seizure, the court shall order the permanent or temporary suspension of issue of the publication and, in grave cases, shall also prohibit the exercise of the profession of journalist by the person convicted.

The jurisdiction of the Representative of the Throne shall be determined by the same Royal Decree. Art. 50. In the event of the death of the King, if the successor be of age and absent, the Council of Ministers shall exercise the Constitutional royal authority until the successor shall have arrived and taken the oath.

The guardian of the infant King, whether the be appointed by will or elected by Parliament, shall be a Greek citizen of the Eastern faith. Art. 52. Should the Throne become vacant, Parliament, even if its term

412

Greece

Art. 53. Should the King, on account of sickness, deem necessary the establishment of a Regency, he shall by Royal Decree appoint as Regent the successor to the Throne or, if there be no successor or if he be a minor, the Queen. Should the King not be in a position to reign, the Council of Ministers shall forthwith convoke Parliament, even if its term be ended or it be dissolved. Should Parliament recognize the need for a Regency by a decision taken by a majority of three fourths of the votes cast, the Regency shall be exercised by the successor, if he be of age, or, if there be no successor of age, by the Queen. If the Queen be deceased, the Council of Ministers shall convoke Parliament which, if there be no successor shall pass a special law on the exercise of the royal authority, or if the successor be a minor, shall by open ballot elect a Regent and, if need be, a guardian of the King.

Art. 56. Parliament cannot debate unless at least one third of the total number of its members are present, nor can it make any decision without an absolute majority of the members present, which majority shall under no circumstances be less than one fourth of the total number of deputies. In the case of an equally divided vote the motion shall be rejected. Art. 57. Every bill must have an explanatory report appended thereto and shall be referred to a Parliamentary Committee.

Greece

413

by the competent. Minister or the rapporteur of the committee if no such report was made upon submission of the bill. Bills designed to amend legislation on pensions or to grant a pension or to recognize services as affording the right to a pension shall be submitted only by the Minister of Finance following a recommendation of the Office of the Comptroller-General. In the case of pensions involving an increase in the budgetary expenditure of semi-governmental agencies the bill shall be submitted by the competent Minister and the Minister of Finance. Such bills on pensions must be specific, the insertion of provisions regarding pensions in laws designed to settle other matters being prohibited. No bill involving an increase in budgetary expenditure, if submitted by the Ministers, shall be introduced for discussion unless accompanied by a report of the General Accounting Office determining the increase in expenditure or reduction in revenue involved.

No bill shall be adopted unless it has been discussed and voted upon by Parliament twice at two different meetings removed from each other by at least two days, in principle and by article during the first debate and by article and as a whole during the second debate. If during the second debate additions or amendments are adopted, the vote on the whole shall be postponed for twenty-four hours from the distribution of the amended draft. The vote on a bill as a whole and by article in a single debate shall, by exception, be permitted if requested by the proposer before the bill has

414

Greece

been referred to the committee provided for by paragraph 1 of this Article and provided that the committee in question has granted the request of the proposer and that no objection is raised by at least twenty deputies after submission of the bill up to the end of the debate thereon. The voting of judicial or administrative codes compiled by special committees established under special laws may be effected by a separate law ratifying the codes as a whole. The codification of existing provisions by a single classification thereof or the re-enactment as a whole of repealed laws, except for taxation laws, may be effected in the same manner. Art. 58.

Parliament shall have the right to forward petitions addressed to it to the Ministers, who shall be obliged to furnish the explanation demanded; Parliament may likewise appoint committees of its members for the purpose of conducting inquiries.

Their resignation shall be submitted in writing and their return to the office from which they resigned shall be prohibited for one year after elections. Officers of the Armed and security Forces who resign in order to be elected as Deputies may not be nominated as candidates nor elected as Deputies in a district in which they served for over six months during the last two years before the elections, unless it is the district in which they have exercised their electoral rights; nor can they ever return to the Armed Forces. Salaried civil servants may not be elected as Deputies nor nominated as candidates in the electoral district in which they were serving during the last three years before their election. The duties of Deputy shall be incompatible with the functions of a director or other executive representative or salaried legal adviser or employee of a commercial firm or enterprise enjoying special privileges or receiving a regular subsidy by virtue of a special law. Persons coming under any of these categories must, within eight days from the time their election becomes final, declare their choice between the office of Deputy and the above-mentioned functions. Failing such declaration they shall ipso facto forfeit the office of Deputy. It may be established by law that the office of Deputy shall be incompatible with further functions. Deputies may not rent State-owned agricultural estates or undertake procurement for the State or contracts for the construction of public works or for the collection of public taxes or accept concessions on Stateowned estates. Violation of the foregoing provision shall involve forfeiture of the office of Deputy and invalidity of the act. Such acts shall also be null and void when they are performed by commercial companies or enterprises in which the functions of director or member of the board of directors or legal adviser are exercised by aDeputy or when the Deputy is a general partner or special partner thereof.
