Translation CONSTITUTION OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND

SOMDET PHRA PARAMINTHARAMAHA BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ SAYAMINTHARATHIRAT BOROMANATTHABOPHIT Enacted on the 22nd day of December B.E. 2521 Being the 33rd Year of the Present Reign. May there be virtue. Today is the eighth day of the waning moon in the first month of the year of Goat under the lunar calendar, being Friday, the twenty second day of December under the solar calendar, in the 2521st year of the Buddhist Era. Phrabat Somdet Phra Paramintharamaha Bhumibol Adulyadej Mahitalathibet Ramathibodi Chakkri Narubodin Sayamintharathirat Borommanatthabophit is graciously pleased to proclaim that He was advised by the National Legislative Council that since the grant of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand B.E. 2475 by His Majesty King Prajadhipok Phra Pok Klao Chao Yu Hua, His Majesty's Uncle, there had been amendment to the Constitution and promulgation of new Constitutions on several occasions, and sometimes the changes of situation in the country had resulted in the promulgation of an Interim Constitution, pending the drafting of a permanent Constitution. All Constitutions and Interim Constitutions that had been promulgated were in unity with one another in adhering to the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of the State who should exercise the legislative power through the National Assembly, the executive power through the Council of Ministers, and the judicial power through the Courts. The essential differences between them lied in the forms of the National Assembly and in the relationship between the legislative and the executive powers, depending on the changing situation of the country for the time being. This revealed the faithful adherence of the Thai people to the democratic regime of government with the King
as Head of the State, which was in accordance with the will of His

Majesty's Uncle, King Prajadhipok Phra Pok Klao Chao Yu Hua, in granting the power to administer the State affairs to the Thai people. The adherence to the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of the State had been inherited until the present time. Even the Constitution for the Administration of the Kingdom B.E.2520 had demonstrated such will and entrusted the task of drafting the Constitution to the National Legislative Council so that a general election should be held within the 2521st year of the Buddhist Era. Published in the Government Gazette Vol.95, Part 146, Special Issue, dated 22nd December B.E.2521 (1978)

of the Thai

people, adhering to the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of the State as the means of administering the State affairs, upholding and protecting the right and liberties of the Thai people, and uniting to secure justice, prosperity and happiness for all Thai people. Having carefully determined and revised the Draft Constitution in the light of the situation of the country, the National Legislative Council passed a resolution approving the presentation of the Draft Constitution to the King for His Royal Signature to promulgate it as the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand. Having thoroughly examined the Draft Constitution, the King deemed it expedient to grant His Royal assent in accordance with the resolution of the National Legislative Council. Be it, therefore, commanded by the King that the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand be promulgated to replace, as from the date of its promulgation, the Interim Constitution for the Administration of the Kingdom B.E.2520 promulgated on 9th November B.E.2520.
