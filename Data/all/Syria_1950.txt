THE CONSTITUTION OF SYRIA'
OF SEPTEMBER 5, PREAMBLE

1950

We, the Representatives of the Syrian Arab People, meeting in a Constituent Assembly, by the will of God and the free wish of the people, declare that we have ordained this Constitution in order to achieve the following sacred aims: To establish justice on firm foundations by strengthening the judicial power and strengthening its independence under a free democratic regime, so that the right of every individual shall be guaranteed without fear or discrimination. To safeguard fundamental public freedoms for all citizens and to ensure the enjoyment of those freedoms under law and order, public freedoms being the most noble expressions of individuality, dignity and humanity. To promote the spirit of brotherhood and social consciousness among citizens, so that every individual may feel that he is an integral part of the structure of the country and that the country is in need of him. To strengthen the sense of duty towards the defense of the country, the Republic and the Constitution for whose maintenance every citizen should contribute his life, effort, wealth and knowledge. To liberate citizens from the miseries of poverty, disease, ignorance and fear by establishing a sound economic and social system which achieves social justice, protects worker and peasant, offers security to the weak and the fearful and enables every citizen to have free access to the benefits of the country. To guarantee equality in public duties and the rights proclaimed by the Constitution and confirmed by laws, especially taxation on a progressive basis, so that there may be equality in sacrifice and ability to contribute.

To develop, educate and protect the individual in order that every citizen may feel that he is responsible for the safety of the country and for its present and future; that the country is the immortal and eternal truth; that all Syrians are its guardians until they hand it over to their sons in dignity and high mindedness. This aim shall be achieved by giving the people a sound and patriotic culture, by providing widespread education and creating facilities for this purpose and by promoting the spirit of sacrifice for the good of the community. And, whereas the majority of the people are believers in the Islamic religion, the Government declares its attachment to Islam, and its ideals. We also declare that our people are determined to cement the ties of friendship and cooperation with the peoples of the Moslem and the Arab World, and to build their modern state on those sound ethical bases advocated by Islam and the other Theistic Religions and to combat atheism and moral decadence. And, furthermore, we declare that our people is a part of the whole Arab nation, bound to it with its past, present and future, and is looking forward to the day when our Arab nation shall be united in one State. Our people shall, therefore, assiduously strive to fulfil this sacred desire in freedom and independence. We finally declare that this Preamble is an indivisible part of this Constitution made to remind all citizens of the principles upon which their basic law is founded. We, the Representatives of the Syrian Arab people, pray to Almighty God to preserve our nation and people, to guard against all calamities, to guide our steps so that our ideals may become living realities thus enabling us to restore the magnificence and glory which our great ancestors have built, and to inaugurate for our sons the path to dignity and splendor.
