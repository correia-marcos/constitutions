After this period has expired, Congress may ratify it in one sole debate with the vote of two-thirds of its members and shall immediately send it to the Official Register for its promulgation. If the objection was partial, Congress must consider it during a period of no longer than thirty days counted from the date the presidential objection was delivered and may, in one sole debate, yield to [the objection] and amend the bill, with the favorable vote of a majority of those attending the session. It may also ratify the initially approved bill with a vote of two-thirds of its members. In both cases, Congress shall send the bill to the Official Register for its promulgation. If Congress does not consider the objection during the indicated period, it shall be understood that it has yielded to it and the President of the Republic may arrange for the promulgation of the law in the Official Register.
