Neither the legislative nor executive branch, in any court or authority may restrict, alter or violate any of these guarantees contained here and any power or authority that violates this will be responsible individually for the injury and tried under Title 12 for responsibility under the Constitution, and furthermore, is reputed as a usurper. Article 94. The partial reforms of the Constitution when they are proposed by a quarter of representatives in either of the chambers may be agreed to by two-thirds vote of the elected and sanctioned by the executive, but when public opinion requires for full reforms, proposed and agreed upon the terms referred, shall convene a Constituent Assembly to dictate such. Partial reforms on the guarantees may never be agreed upon but if they are expanding existing ones. Nor can they alter the division of powers. Article 95. El Salvador shall contribute with all her capabilities and efforts to reorganize the Republic of Central America. The Constitution or covenant in their pronouncement that results by a National Convention, by a Constituent Assembly or by Congress or by any other legitimate authority drawn up by the people or the States in such capacity, forming part of El Salvador, is to be religiously fulfilled and executed after obtaining ratification of El Salvador’s legislative power. But if exhausted efforts do not succeed in that reorganization, El Salvador shall continue in the full exercise of its absolute independence and external sovereignty, elevated to the republic until national reunification. COMMUNICATED TO THE EXECUTIVE TO PRINT, PUBLISH, AND CIRCULATE. GIVEN in San Salvador, on February 18, 1841.
