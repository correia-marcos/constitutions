MONTENEGRO.
The Principality of Montenegro was not established in its present form until 1/13 January 1852. Three years later a general Code in 95 articles was promulgated. This Code was a sort of compendium of all the national institutions, political as well as civil, penal and financial, and it proclaimed the equality of all citizens before the law, the inviolability of their rights, as well as regulated the succession to the throne. In 1868 a beginning in constitutional reform was inaugurated, when certain financial powers and the direction of administrative affairs were conferred upon a Senate. Eleven years later the Prince abolished the Senate and created a Council of State, composed of eight members,'half elected by the Prince, half by all the male inhabitants bearing or having borne arms. The legislative and executive powers were exercised, in accord with the sovereign, by this Council of State and by a Council of Ministers. The independence of Montenegro had just been recognized by Article 26 of the-Treaty of Berlin of IS July 1878.1 Two articles of this treaty imposed upon Montenegro equality of religious confessions (Article 27) and inviolability of property (Article 20). The present Constitution was granted by a Proclamation of 18/31 October 1905. A Chamber of 62 deputies was elected on 14 November, and the Prince took oath before it to the new Constitution in the meeting of 6 December.2 CONSTITUTION OF 6/19 DECEMBER 1905.8
