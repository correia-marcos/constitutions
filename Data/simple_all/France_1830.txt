August 14, 1830. Duvergier, Lois, XXX, 110-114.

This constitution should be carefully compared with the Constitutional Charter of 1S14 (No. 93) of which it is a revision. The difference in r.he theories upon which the two documents are based calls for particular notice. REFERENCES.

Law upon Elections.

April 19, 1833. Duvergier, Lois, XXXI, 211-244. The Constitutional Charter of 1814 fixed the tax-paying qualification for membership in the Chamber of Deputies at one thousand francs per annum and for the exercise of the suffrage of three hundred francs. (No. 93, articles 38 and 40.) When the revision of 1830 occurred there was nn informal understanding that these qualifications 3hould be revised. This law was enacted in fulfillment of that understanding and remained unchanged throughout the entire period of the July Monarchy. It raised the number of voters from about 94,000 to about 188,000. The population of France was approximately thirty millions. In connection with this measure notice should be taken of the laws of 1831 upon the Chamber of Peers, municipal government, and the organization of the national guards. The four constitute a sort of supplement to the Constitution of 1830. REFERENCES.
