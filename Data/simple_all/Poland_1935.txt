On the other hand, voting to the Upper Chamber (the Senate) is not based on universal suffrage. The new Constitution, breaking with the mechanical, universal and absolute equality propagated by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789, decides the supreme principle "the rights of a citizen to influence public affairs ujill be estimated according to the value of his efforts and services for the common good" (art. 7). Thus, in accordance ujith the above principle and the role foreseen for the Senate by the Constitution, the Polish Upper Chamber ujill be a body representing those citizens who have distinguished themselves in work for the community or who have shoum personal merit (e. g. been decorated by the civil or military authorities), or ujho have a higher education (diploma of an academic school, or the certificate of a higher type of vocational school), or, finally, trho enjoy the confidence of their fellow-citizens (e. g., occupy an elective position in the territorial or economic self-government bodies). One thing more: those who have created the new Constitution have proclaimed decided opposition to political parties — only too numerous and far from being the disseminaters of sound principles amongst the electorate of the country. The neuj order ujill likewise be found to operate against professional parliamentary politicians in accordance with the ideal, so forcefully expressed in 1898 by Poincar6: "il faul arracher la politique aux politiciens..." The principles of the new Constitution have been given above in their most general outlines; it was enacted on April 23rd., 1935 by the Polish legislative chambers, thereby entering into force as binding law. Amidst all the uncrystallized ideas which are so typical of the present epoch, the new Polish Constitution appears as an attempt to solve the complicated problems of State structure by a method, not based on compulsion, but on the conscious collaboration of the citizens of the country in accordance with the classical principle of: Salus Reipublicae — Suprema Lex.
