ART. 70. If the chamber of origin does not concur in the additions or amendments proposed by the other chamber, it shall have the right, to be exercised not more than once, of returning it to the revising chamber, and insisting upon its passage, alleging its reason for such action. If, in spite of this second presenta-

tion, the revising chamber refuses to strike out the amendments or additions, and these amendments or additio ns refer to the whole bill, then the measure shall be postponed until the next session of Congress; but if the amendments or additions refer only to certain articles, these articles shall be set aside and the bill shall follow its course. ART. 71. All bills or resolutions passed by the two chambers shall be sent for approval to the Executive power. If the approval is granted the bill shall become a law, and the Executive shall order it to be promulgated and executed; but if the approval is refused the Executive shall return the bill with his objections to the chamber where it originated within nine days. The bills passed by both chambers as urgent shall be approved or disapproved by the Executive within three days, but the Executive shall have no power to pass opinion on the urgency of the measure. ART. 72. If the chamber should consider that the objections of the Executive are well founded, and if said objections refer to the whole act, the latter shall be sent to the archives, and shall not be reintroduced until the next session of Congress. If the objections of the Executive refer to provisions which in its opinion need correction or amendment, the corrections or amendments suggested shall be discussed and disposed of in one debate. ART. 73. If the majority of the members present refuse their assent to the objections made by the Executive to the whole act, the chamber where the bill originated shall refer it, with the proper explanations, to the other chamber. If the latter finds that the objections of the Executive are well founded, the bill shall be returned in order that it may be kept in the

archives. But if a majority of the members of the revising chamber finds that the objections of the Executive are not well founded, the bill shall then be sent to the Executive for approval, which, in that case, shall not be refused. ART. 74. If the Executive does not return the bill, either approved or disapproved, within the period of nine days, or of three incases of urgency, or if the Executive refuses his approval after all the constitutional requisites have been complied with, the act shall become a law. But if during the periods above stated Congress adjourns, either temporarily or finally, the act shall then be pub ished in the newspapers, together with the objections thereto, and shall be introduced again during the first three days of the next meeting. If not published, together with the objections, within a period of nine days, the bill shall become a law. ART. 75. All bills and resolutions upon which no action has been taken, as well as all those rejected or disapproved, shall be published in the newspapers, together with an explanation of the reasons preventing them from becoming laws. ART. 76. The bills and resolutions sent to the Executive for approval shall be forwarded in duplicate, and signed by the presidents and secretaries of each chamber. They shall be accompanied by a statement of the days on which they were discussed. ART. 77. If the Executive notes that the provisions of articles 68, 69, and 70 have not been complied with in regard to some bill or resolution, sent to it for approval, the two copies aforesaid shall be returned within three days to the chamber where the error was committed, in order that, said error having been corrected, the measure may go on through its

constitutional stages. But if no error is found, the act shall be either approved or disapproved, and one of the copies, properly indorsed by the Executive, shall be returned to the chamber where it originated. ART. 78. If the chamber where the bill originated has adjourned, the days of the adjournment shall not be counted in making up the periods of time set forth in article 74. ART. 79. The resolutions of Congress directing its sittings to be transferred to some other place, granting or refusing extraordinary powers, causing elections to be held, accepting resignations and excuses, or providing rules for its interior government, shall not require the intervention of the Executive. Nor shall said intervention be necessary for any act which can be executed by one chamber alone. ART. 80. Congress shall use for its laws, the following enacting clause : "The	 of the ReCongress public of Ecuador decrees." The form of approval or disapproval to be used by the Executive power shall be: " Let it be executed," or "Let it be objected." ART. 81. The same rules which have been established for the enactment of the laws shall be followed for their interpretation, amendment, or repeal. ART. 82. The laws have no binding force except by virtue of their promulgation. ART. 83. The laws shall be promulgated by the Executive power within six days subsequent to their having become such; and if the said period is allowed to pass without the promulgation being made by the Executive, the council of state shall then make the said promulgation, within the following six days, under its strictest responsibility.

Both periods may, however, be shortened or extended by the law itself, and in this case a special period shall be fixed. TITLE VII.
