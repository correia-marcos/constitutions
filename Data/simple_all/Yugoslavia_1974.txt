THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
INTRODUCTORY PART BASIC PRINCIPLES
The nations of Yugoslavia, proceeding from the right of every nation to self-determination, including the right to secession, on the basis of their will freely expressed in the common struggle of all nations and nationalities in the National Liberation War and Socialist Revolution, and in conformity with their historic aspirations, aware that further consolidation of their brotherhood and unity is in the common interest, have, together with the nationalities, with which they live, united in a federal republic of free and equal nations and nationalities and founded a socialist federal community of working people — the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in which, in the interests of each nation and nationality separately and of all of them together, they shall realize and ensure: socialist social relations based on self-management by working people and the protection of the socialist self-management system; national freedom and independence; the brotherhood and unity of the nations and nationalities; the uniform interests of the working class, and solidarity among workers and all working people; possibilities and freedoms for the all-round development of the human personality and for the rapprochement of the nations and nationalities, in conformity with their interests and aspirations on the road to the creation of an ever richer culture and civilization in a socialist society; the unification and adjustment of efforts to develop the economic foundations of a socialist society and the prosperity of the people; a system of socio-economic relations and uniform foundations for a political system which will ensure the common interests of the working class and all working people and the equality of the nations and nationalities; the linking of Yugoslavia's aspirations with the progressive strivings of mankind. The working people and the nations and nationalities shall exercise their sovereign rights in the Socialist Republics, and in the Socialist Autonomous Provinces in conformity with their constitutional rights, and shall exercise these rights in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia when in

their common interests it is so specified by the present Constitution. The working people, nations and nationalities shall make decisions in the Federation according to the principles of agreement among the Republics and Autonomous Provinces, solidarity and reciprocity, equal participation by the Republics and Autonomous Provinces in federal agencies, in line with the present Constitution, and according to the principle of responsibility of the Republics and Autonomous Provinces for their own development and for the development of the socialist community as a whole. II The socialist social system of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is based on the power of the working class and all working people and on relations among people as free and equal producers and creators whose labour serves exclusively for the satisfaction of their personal and common needs. These relationships are based on the socio-economic status of the working man which ensures him that, by working with socially-owned resources and by deciding directly and on an equal footing with other working people in associated labour on all matters concerning social reproductions under conditions and relations of mutual interdependence, responsibility and solidarity, he shall realize his personal material and moral interests and the right to benefit from the results of his current and past labours and from the achievements of general material and social progress, and that on this basis he shall satisfy his personal and social needs and develop his working and other creative abilities. In conformity with this, man's inviolable status and role shall be based on: the social ownership of the means of production which precludes the return of any kind of system of exploitation of man, and which, by ending the alienation of the working class and working people from the means of production and other conditions of labour, ensures self-management by the working people in procudtion, in the distribution of the product of labour, and in guidance of the development of society on self-management foundations; the emancipation of labour as a means of transcending the historically conditioned socio-economic inequalities and dependence of people in labour, which shall be ensured through the elimination of antagonism between labour and capital and of any

form of wage-labour relationships, the all round development of productive forces, a rise in labour productivity, a reduction in working hours, the development and application of science and technical achievements, the increasing provision of higher education for all, and a rise in the culture of the working people; the right to self-management, on the basis of which every working man, on an equal footing with other working people, shall decide on his own labour and on the conditions and results of labour, on his own and common interests, and on the guidance of social development, and shall exercise power and manage other social affairs; the right of the working man to enjoy the fruits of his labour and of the economic progress of the social community in keeping with the principle: »From each according to his abilities — to each according to his labour,« provided he ensures the development of the economic foundations of his own and social labour and contributes to the satisfaction of other social needs; man's economic, social and personal security; solidarity and reciprocity by everyone towards all and by all towards everyone, based on the awareness of the working people that they can realize their lasting interests only on the basis of these principles; free initiative in the development of production and other social and personal activities for the benefit of man and the social community; democratic political relations which make it possible for man to realize his interests, the right to self-management and other rights, to develop his personality through direct activity in social life, and especially in bodies of self-management, sociopolitical organizations and other social organizations and associations, which he himself sets up and through which he exercises an influence on the development of social consciousness and on the expansion of conditions for his own activity and for the attainment of his interests and rights; equality of rights, duties and responsibilities of people, in conformity with constitutionality and legality.* The socio-economic and political system stems from this position of man and it shall serve him and his role in society. Any form of the management of production and of other social activities, and any form of distribution that distorts social relationships based on the above defined position of man — be it through bureaucratic arbitrariness, technocratic usurpation or privileges based on the monopoly of management

of the means of production, or the appropriation of social resources on a group-property basis or any other mode of privatization of these resources, or in the form of private-property or particularist selfishness, or through any form restricting the working class in playing its historic role in socioeconomic and political relations and in organizing power for itself and for all working people, shall be contrary to the socio-economic and political system laid down by the present Constitution.

III
Social ownership, as an expression of socialist socio-economic relationships among people, shall be the basis of free associated labour and of the ruling position of the working class in production and in social reproduction as a whole; it shall also be the basis of personal property acquired through one's own labour and serving for the satisfaction of man's needs and interests. Socially-owned means of production, being the common, inalienable basis of social labour and social reproduction, shall exclusively serve as a basis for the performance of work aimed at the satisfaction of the personal and common needs and interests of the working people and at the development of the economic foundations of socialist society and socialist relations of self-management. Sociallyowned means of production, including the means for expanded reproduction, 5 shall be managed directly by associated workers working with these means, in their own interests and in the interests of the working class and socialist society. In per' forming these social functions associated workers shall be responsible to one another and to the socialist community as a whole. Social ownership of the means of production and other resources shall ensure that everyone becomes integrated, under equal conditions, into associated labour working with social resources, and that, by realizing his right to work with social resources, and on the basis of his own labour, he earns income for the satisfaction of this personal and common needs. Since no one has the right of ownership over social means of production, nobody — not sociopolitical cormnunities,6 nor organizations of associated labour, nor groups of citizens, nor individuals — may appropriate on any legal-property grounds the product of social labour or manage and dispose of the social means of production and labour, or arbitrarily determine conditions for distribution.

Man's labour shall be the only basis for the appropriation of the product of social labour and for the management of social resources. The distribution of income between the part which serves for the expansion of the economic foundations of social labour and the part which serves for the satisfaction of the personal and common needs of working people in conformity with the principle of distribution according to work performed, shall be decided upon by the working people who generate this income, in compliance with mutual responsibility and solidarity and with socially-determined fundamentals of and criteria for the acquisition and distribution of income. Resources earmarked for the replacement and expansion of the economic foundations of social labour shall be the common basis for the maintenance and development of society, i. e. for social reproduction realized on the basis of self-management by the working people through all forms of pooling of labour and resources and through mutual cooperation among organizations of associated labour. The basic organizations of associated labour, which are the fundamental form of associated labour in which workers exercise their inalienable right by working with social resources to manage their own labour and conditions of labour and to decide on the results of their labour, shall be the basis of all forms of pooling of labour and resources and of self-management integration. By realizing the results of their joint labour in terms of value on the market under conditions of socialist commodity production, workers, through direct linkage, self-management agreements and social compacts concluded by their organizations of associated labour and other self-managing organizations and communities, and by planning work and development, shall integrate social labour, promote the entire system of socialist socio-economic relations, and control the blind forces of the market. The money and credit system shall be a constituent part of relations in social reproduction based on self-management by workers in associated labour working with social resources, and the entire income realized in these relations shall be in inalienable part of income of the basic organizations of associated labour. Proceeding from the interdependence of production and the trade and financial spheres of associated labour, as parts of the unified system of social reproduction, workers in organizations of associated labour shall regulate their mutual relations in social reproduction and shall cooperate in such a

way as will ensure workers in production the right to decide on the results of their own current and past labour in the entirety of these relations. The working people shall ensure the satisfaction of their personal and common needs and interests in the field of education, science, culture, health and other social activities, which are part of the unified process of social labour, by freely exchanging and pooling their labour and the labour of workers in organizations of associated labour operating in the above fields. Working people shall achieve this free exchange of labour directly, through organizations of associated labour and within the framework of or through selfmanaging communities of interest' Such relations shall ensure the working people in these activities the same socio-economic status as that enjoyed by workers in other organizations of associated labour. To achieve a fuller, more rational and organized satisfaction of their personal and common needs and interests in social activities and in specific activities in material production, the working people shall, together with workers in organizations of associated labour in these activities, set up communities of interest in which they shall freely exchange labour and directly regulate relations of common interest. Workers and working people shall also form self-managing communities of interests by pooling resources on the basis of the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. Working people who independently carry out activities with their own personal labour and resources in citizens' ownership shall on the basis of their own labour, in principle, have the same socioeconomic status and basically the same rights and obligations as workers in organizations of associated labour. Enjoying the right of ownership of arable land, as spelled out in the present Constitution, farmers shall have the right and obligation to exploit this land for the purpose of promoting agricultural production in their own interest and in the interest of the socialist community. The socialist community shall give full support to farmers in raising the productivity of their labour and in freely associating in cooperatives and other forms of association in order to promote the conditions of their work and life. To achieve organized integration of farmers in socialist self-management socio-economic relations and to foster agricultural production, conditions shall be ensured for the development of agriculture on the basis of social resources and social labour, and so shall conditions for the association of

farmers in, and their cooperation with, organizations of associated labour according to the principles of free choice and equality. In order to provide economic foundations for the equality of the nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia, and to equalize the economic conditions of the social life and work of the working people, and to achieve the most harmonious possible development of the economy as a whole, in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia special attention shall, in the common interest, be paid to the faster development of productive forces in economically underdeveloped Republics and Autonomous Provinces, and to this end the necessary resources shall be ensured and other measures taken. In order to promote the conditions of life and work, create foundations for their stability and the fullest utilization of possibilities for the development of society's productive forces and for raising the productivity of their own and total social labour, to develop socialist relations of self-management on this basis, and to control the blind forces of the market, workers in basic and other organizations of associated labour and working people in self-managing communities of interest and other self-managing organizations and communities, and also in socio-political communities, shall, by relying on science and the assessment of development possibilities based thereon, and by planning their work and development, adjust relations in social reproduction and direct the development of social production and other social activities to serve their common interests and aims determined on a selfmanagement basis. Iv In the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia all power shall be vested in the working class in affiance with all working people in towns and villages. In order to create a society of free producers, the working class and all working people shall develop socialist self-management democracy as a special form of the dictatorship of the proletariat; they shall ensure this through: the revolutionary abolition of and constitutional ban on any form of socio-economic and political relations and organization based on class exploitation and property monopoly, or on any kind of political action aimed at the establishment of such relations; the realization of self-management in organizations of associated labour, local communities, 8 self-

managing communities of interest and other selfmanaging organizations and communities, and also in socio-political communities and society as a whole, and through the mutual linkage of and cooperation among these organizations and communities; the free and equal self-management regulation of mutual relations and the adjustment of the common and general interests of the working people and their self-managing organizations and communities by self-management agreements and social compacts; decision-making by the working people in the realization of power and in the management of other social affairs in the basic organizations of associated labour and other basic self-managing organizations and communities, through delegations and delegates in the managing bodies of self-managing organizations and communities, and also through delegations and delegates to the assemblies of the socio-political communities and other bodies of self-management; keeping the working people informed on all questions significant for the realization of their socio-economic status and for the fullest and most competent possible decision-making in the performance of functions of power and management of other social affairs; the public character of work of all organs of power and self-management and of holders of self-management, public and other social function; personal responsibility of the holders of selfmanagement, public and other social functions, responsibility of the organs of power and selfmanagement, recallability of the holders of selfmanagement, public and other social functions, and restriction of their re-election and re-appointment to specific functions; realization of supervision by workers and other working people and of social control in general over the work of the holders of self-management, public and other social functions in self-managing organizations and communities and in socio-political communities; realization and protection of constitutionality and legality; socio-political activity by socialist forces organized in socio-political organizations; free and all-round activity by people. Self-management by the working people in the basic organizations of associated labour, local communities, self-managing communities of interest and other basic self-managing organizations and communities shall be the basis of a uniform system

of self-management by and power of the working class and all working people. In order to ensure conditions for their life and work and for social development and the creation of the socialist community, working people in the Communes, as self-managing and basic socio-political communities, shall realize their common interests, exercise power, and manage other social affairs by linking their organizations of associated labour and other self-managing organizations and communities, through the activity of socio-political organizations, and through self-management agreements, social compacts and the functioning of the assemblies as the common bodies of all working people and their organizations and communities. The constitutionally-established functions of power and management of social affairs in sociopolitical communities shall be conducted by the assemblies of the socio-political communities, as elected and recallable delegations of the working people in self-managing organizations and communities and socio-political organizations, and by other agencies responsible to the assemblies. In order to ensure the fullest possible participation of the working people and all organized socialist forces in the realization of power and management of other social affairs, and in order to adjust their common and general social interests, agencies of the socio-political communities shall consider initiatives, opinions and proposals of socio-political organizations, take stands thereon, and cooperate with socio-political organizations. The working class and all working people shall through state power by means of generally-binding rules secure socialist social relations, the development of society and the management of social affairs on a self-management basis, protect the freedoms of man and the citizen, socialist self-management relations and the self-management rights of the working people, and shall settle social conflicts and protect the constitutionally-established order. The self-management status and rights of the working man in basic and other organizations of associated labour, local communities, self-managing communities of interest and in other self-management organizations and communities, the self-management status of the working people in the Communes, free association on the basis of selfmanagement, activities and creative endeavour by the working people, the equality of the nations and nationalities and the freedom, rights and duties of man and the citizen, as laid down by the present Constitution, shall be the basis, limit and

direction for the realization of the rights and duties of the socio-political communities in exercising the functions of power. Social self-protection, as a function of a society based on self-management, shall be achieved through activities by working people, citizens, organizations of associated labour and other self-managing organizations and communities, socio-political other organizations and the socio-political communities, with a view to safeguarding constitutional order, the self-management rights of the working people, and other rights and freedoms of man and the citizen, protecting social property, ensuring the personal and property security of the working people and citizens, and achieving free social development. In order to realize and adjust their interests and self-managing rights in line with the general interests of socialist society, and in order to conduct specific social affairs and develop various activities, the working people and citizens shall freely combine in socio-political and other social organizations and citizens' associations, as constituent part of the socialist system based on selfmanagement. Socio-political organizations, as a form of free socialist political organization of working people based on class socialist foundations, shall be constituent parts of and active factors in the development and protection of socialist society based on self-management. The freedoms, rights and duties of man and the citizen, as spelled out by the present Constitution, are an inseparable part and expression of democratic socialist self-management relations in which man is becoming liberated from any form of exploitation and arbitrariness and with his labour is creating conditions for the all-round and free expression and protection of his personality and respect for human dignity. The freedoms and rights of man and the citizen shall only be restricted by the equal freedoms and rights of others and by the interests of socialist society. Socialist society shall ensure conditions for the fullest possible realization and protection of the freedoms and rights laid down by the present Constitution. Any activity infringing the freedom and rights of man and the citizen shall be contrary to the interests of socialist society. Proceeding from the fact that education, science and culture are essential factors in the development of socialist society, the rise in labour productivity, the development of people's creative forces and the all-round development of the human

personality, the humanization socialist relations of self-management and society's general progress, the socialist community shall ensure freedom of creative endeavour and create conditions for the development and promotion of education, scientific, cultural and artistic creativity, so that they may contribute as successfully as possible to the rise in the creative abilities of the working people, the promotion of socialist social relations and the all-round development of a free and humanized personality. The system of upbringing and education shall be based on the achievements of modern science, especially of Marxism as the foundation of scientific socialism, and shall be instrumental in training young people for work and self-management and educating them in the spirit of achievements of the Socialist Revolution, the socialist code of ethics, self-management democracy, socialist patriotism, brotherhood and unity, the equality of the nations and nationalities, and socialist internationalism. The working people in organizations of associated labour and other self-managing organizations and communities shall, on the basis of solidarity, reciprocity and socialist humanism, ensure their economic and social security, and shall create increasingly favourable conditions for their life and work for the development of an all-round personality in the working man. These aims of welfare policy shall be attained through the constant improvement and equalization of the conditions of life. and work, the transcendence, on the basis of solidarity and reciprocity, of differences stemming from economic undevelopment and other unequal conditions of life and work, the equalization of possibilities for education and work, and through the prevention and elimination of social differences which are not based on the application of the principle of distribution according to work performed. The socialist social community shall ensure financial and other conditions for the realization of the rights of veterans, disabled veterans, and dependents of fallen veterans, which guarantee their social security. In order to conserve and improve the human environment, working people and citizens, organizations of associated labour, other self-managing organizations and communities and socialist society shall ensure conditions to preserve and improve natural and other values of the human environment conducive to a healthy, safe and active life and work for the present and future generations.

VI The working people and citizens, nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia are determined to direct their forces towards peaceful creative work and the construction of their self-management socialist community, and consistently to pursue a policy of peace and against aggression, war and aggressive pressure of any kind. In order to secure their peaceful development and socialist construction, they are determined with all available forces and resources, through armed struggle and other forms of total national defence, to protect and defend their freedom, independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the socialist self-management order of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. For this purpose the working people and citizens and the nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia shall organize and build up a system of total national defence, as an inseparable part of the socialist self-management social system, aware that the defensive ability of society and the defensive preparedness of the country is the greater and possibility for aggression the smaller the more developed total national defence as a form and substance of the defensive organization of the social community is. The strengthening of the defensive ability of the country shall be component part of the policy of peace and international cooperation based on terms of equality. Total national defence in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is an integrated system covering the organization, preparation and participation of the Federation, Republics, Autonomous Provinces, Communes, organizations of associated labour, local communities, self-managing communities of interest and other self-managing organizations and communities, socio-political and social organizations, working people and citizens in armed struggle and in all other forms of resistance, and in the performance of other duties concerning the defence of the country. In total national defence armed struggle shall be the decisive form of resisting aggression. The Armed Forces of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall be the principle factors in armed struggle and shall be a unified whole. The supreme administration and command of the Armed Forces shall ensure the unity and indivisibility of armed struggle.

VII Proceeding from the conviction that peaceful coexistence and active cooperation among states

and peoples, irrespective of differences in their social systems, are indispensable conditions for peace and social progress in the world, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall base its international relations on the principles of respect for national sovereignty and equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, socialist internationalism, and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means. In its international relations the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter, fulfil its international commitments and take an active part in the activities of the international organizations to which it is affiliated. In order to carry these principles into effect the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall strive: for the establishment and development of all forms of international cooperation conducive to the consolidation of peace, the strengthening of mutual respect, equality and friendship among nations and states and their rapprochement; for the broadest and freest possible exchange of material and intellectual goods, for the freedom of mutual exchange of information and for the development of other relations contributory to the realization of common economic, cultural and other interests of states, nations and people, especially to the development of democratic and socialist relations in international cooperation, and to socialist progress in general, to the overcoming of the bloc devisiveness of the world, to renunciation of the use of force or threat of force in international relations and to the attainment of general and complete disarmament; for the right of every nation freely to determine and build up its own social and political system by ways and means of its own free choice; for the right of nations to self-determination and national independence, and for their right to wage a liberation war to attain these aims; for respect for the rights of national minorities, including the rights of members of Yugoslav nations living in other countries as national minorities; for international support for peoples waging a just struggle for their national independence and liberation from imperialism, colonialism and all other forms of national oppression and subjugation; for the development of such international cooperation as will ensure equality in economic relations in the world, sovereign exploitation of nati-

onal natural resources, and the creation of conditions conducive to the accelerated development of underdeveloped countries; for respect for generally accepted rules of international law. In pressing for all-round political, economic and cultural cooperation with other nations and states, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as a socialist community of nations, holds the view that this cooperation should contribute to the creation of those democratic forms of linkage among states, nations and people, which suit the interests of nations and social progress, and is in this respect an open cummunity. All agencies, organizations and individuals shall be bound in international economic, political, cultural and other relations, and in their relations with agencies and organizations abroad, to abide by these principles of the foreign policy and international activity of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and to strive for their realization.

VIII The League of Communists of Yugoslavia, as the initiator and organizer of the National Liberation War and Socialist Revolution, and as the conscious champion of the aspirations and interests of the working class, has become, by the laws of historical development, the leading organized ideological and political force of the working class and of all working people in the creation of socialism and in the realization of solidarity among the working people and of brotherhood and unity among the nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia. Under conditions of socialist democracy and social self-management, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, with its guiding ideological and political action, shall be the prime mover and exponent of political activity aimed at safeguarding and further developing the socialist revolution and socialist social relations of self-management, and especially at the strengthening of socialist social and democratic consciousness, and shall be responsible therefore. The Socialist Alliance of the Working People of Yugoslavia, created during the National Liberation War and Socialist Revolution as a voluntary and democratic front of the working people and citizens and all organized socialist forces, headed by the Communist Party, and further developed under conditions of a socialist society based on self-management, shall be the broadest base for

socio-political activity in the socialist system of self-management. In the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of Yugoslavia the working people and citizens, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, as the leading ideological and political force, and other sociopolitical organizations and all organized socialist forces shall realize the political and actional unity of socialist forces and shall guide social development on the foundations of the power of and selfmanagement by the working class and all working people, and for this purpose they shall: discuss social questions and take political initiative in all fields of social life, adjust views, lay down political stands regarding the solution of these questions, the guidance of social development, the realization of the rights and interests of the working people and citizens, the realization of the equality of the nations and nationalities and the promotion of socialist self-management democratic relations, submit proposals for the solution of social questions, and issue guidelines to their delegates to the assemblies of socio-political communities; draw up joint programmes for social activity and lay down common criteria for the election of delegations in the basic organizations of associated labour, local communities and other self-managing organizations and communities, and for the election of delegates to the assemblies of the sociopolitical communities; ensure democratic proposition and determination of candidates for members of delegations in self-managing organizations and communities and candidates for delegates to the assemblies of the socio-political communities, and candidates for the performance of self-management, public and other social functions in the socio-political communities; consider general issues of cadre policy and the formation of cadres, and lay down criteria for the selection of cadres; review the work of the organs of power and of the managing bodies of self-managing, organizations and communities and of the holders of self-management, public and other social functions, express their opinions and pass judgements and exercise social supervision over and criticism of their work, especially with regard to ensuring the publicity of and responsibility for their work; create conditions for the all-round participation of young people and their organizations in social and political life; make sure that the working people and citizens are kept informed, and ensure their influence on the social system of information and the realization of the role of the press and other media of

public information and communication; fight for humane relationships among people, for the development of socialist democratic consciousness and norms of socialist life, and to prevent practices which check the development of socialist self-management democratic social relations or are in any way harmful to them. Within the framework of their rights and duties, the socio-political communities shall be obliged to secure material and other conditions for the realization of the constitutionally defined functions of the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of Yugoslavia. Workers organized on a voluntary basis in trade unions, as the broadest organizations of the working class, shall strive to: realize the constitutionally-defined status of the working class; achieve socialist self-management relations and the decisive role of the workers in the management of social reproduction; realize the interests and selfmanagement and other rights of workers in all fields of work and life, ensure equality among workers in the pooling of labour and resources, the acquisition and distribution of income and the determination of common scales for distribution according to the results of labour; ensure selfmanagement linkage and integration of various fields of social labour; further the development of the productive forces of society and the raising of labour productivity; guide self-management adjustment of individual, common and general social interests; take care of the education of workers and their training for the performance of selfmanagement and other social functions; ensure democratic proposition and determination of candidates for delegates to managing bodies in organizations of associated labour and other self-managing organizations and communities, and of candidates for delegations in these organizations and communities, and for delegates to the assemblies of the socio-political communities; ensure the broadest possible participation of workers in the exercise of the functions of power and management of other social affairs; realize the interests of the working class in cadre policy; protect workers' rights; ensure workers social security, the development of their standard of living, and the development and strengthening of solidarity and the raising of the class consciousness and responsibility among self-managers. Trade unions shall initiate self-management agreements and social compacts and take direct part in their negotiation; they shall submit proposals to the managing bodies of self-managing orga-

nizations and communities, the assemblies of the socio-political communities and other state and social agencies concerning the solution of questions relating to the economic and social position of the working class. IX The socio-economic and political system and other relations laid down by the present Constitution are aimed at broadening conditions for the further development of socialist society, overcoming its contradictions, and achieving such social progress as will, on the basis of the all-round development of the productive forces, high labour productivity, affluence of products, and the allround development of man as an emancipated personality, make possible the development of those social relations in which the Communist principle: "From each according to his abilities; to each according to his needs," shall be realized. To this end bodies of self-management, state agencies, self-management organizations and communities, socio-political and other organizations, working people and citizens directly — are called upon through the entirety of their activities: to expand and strengthen the economic foundations of society and the life of individuals by developing productive forces, raising the productivity of labour and continually promoting socialist selfmanagement relations; to create conditions under which the socio-economic differences between intellectual and physical labour will gradually be transcended and under which human labour will tend to become an ever fuller expression of creative endeavour and of the human personality; to expand and develop all forms of self-management and socialist self-management democracy, especially in those fields where the functions of political power predominate; to curb coercion and create conditions for its elimination; and to build up relations among people based on an awareness of common interests, on the socialist code of ethics, and man's free creative endeavour; to contribute to the realization of human freedoms and rights, the humanization of the social environment and the human personality, the strengthening of solidarity and humaneness among people, and to respect for human dignity; to develop all-round cooperation and rapprochement with all nations, in keeping with the progressive aspirations of mankind for the creation of a free community of all nations of the world.

By expressing the basic principles of a socialist society based on self-management and its progress, this section of the present Constitution shall be both the basis of and a directive for the interpretation of the constitution and laws, and for the action of all and everyone.

PART TWO THE SOCIAL SYSTEM
Chapter I THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEM I. The Status of Man in Associated Labour,

and Social Property
Article 10 The socialist socio-economic system of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall be based on freely associated labour and socially-owned means of production, and on self-management by the working people in production and in the distribution of the social product in basic and other organizations of associated labour and in social reproduction as a whole. Article 11 Man's economic and social status shall be determined by labour and the results of labour, on the basis of equal right; and responsibilities. No one may gain any material of other benefits, directly or indirectly, by exploiting the labour of others. No one may in any way make it impossible for a worker to decide or restrict him in deciding, on an equal footing with other workers on his labour and the conditions and results of his labour. Article 12 The means of production and other means of associated labour, products generated by associated labour and income realized through associated labour, resources for the satisfaction of common and general social needs, natural resources and goods in common use shall be social property. No one may acquire the right of ownership of social resources which are conditions of labour in basic and other organizations of associated labour or are the economic foundations for the realization of the functions of self-managing communities of interest or of other self-managing organizations and communities and of socio-political communities. Social resources may not be used for the appropriation. Article 13 Workers in associated labour working with socially-owned resources shall have the inalienable

right to work with these resources to satisfy their personal and social needs and to manage, freely and on an equal footing with other workers in associated labour, their labour and the conditions and results thereof. The rights, obligations and responsibilities concerning the disposal, utilization and management of social resources shall be regulated by the constitution and statute, in line with the nature and purpose of these resources.
Article 14

Exercising their right to work with sociallyowned resources, all workers in associated labour working with socially-owned resources, shall be guaranteed the right in the basic organizations of associated labour in which they work and in any other forms of pooling of labour and resources, together and on equal footing with other workers, to manage the work and business of the organizations of associated labour and the affairs and resources in, the totality of relations of social reproduction, to regulate mutual relations in labour, to decide on income realized through various forms of pooling of labour and resources, and to earn personal income. Basic organizations of associated labour are the basic forms of associated labour in which the workers directly and on terms of equality realize their socio-economic and other self-management rights and decide on other questions concerning their socio-economic status. Any act or conduct that violates these rights of the workers shall be unconstitutional. .
Article 15

In exercising the right to work with social resources, workers in associated labour shall in their common and general social interest be mutually responsible for using these resources in a socially and economically opportune manner, for constantly renewing, expanding and improving them, as the economic foundations of their own and of total social labour, and for fulfilling their working obligations conscientiously. In the exe-cise of their right to work with social resources, workers in associated labour may not acquire material benefits or other advantages that are not based on their labour.
Article 16

Workers in organizations of associated labour

active in the fields of education, science, culture, social welfare, and other social activities shall earn income through a free exchange of their labour for the labour of the working people whose needs and interests in these fields they serve. Workers in such organizations of associated labour shall carry out this free exchange of labour directly with the working people whose needs and interest they serve, or through their organizations of associated labour and self-managing communities of interest, or within the framework of selfmanaging communities of interest. Through a free exchange of labour workers in organizations of associated labour in social activities shall have the same socio-economic status as workers in organizations of associated labour in other activities. The principles of free exchange of labour shall also apply to the earning of income by workers in organizations of associated labour in other activities in which the action of market laws cannot be a basis for the adjustment of work and needs, nor a basis for assessing the value of labour. Article 17 Total income resulting from the joint labour of workers in a basic organization of associated labour and from total social labour, earned through various forms of the pooling of labour and resources on the basis of the action of market laws and of the conditions of income earning socially-determined on a self-management basis, shall be decided upon by workers in basic organizations of associated labour in conformity with their constitutional rights and responsibilities towards other workers in associated labour and toward the social community as a whole. Basic organizations of associated labour shall distribute among themselves the entire income jointly realized through the pooling of labour and resources according to their contribution to the realization of this income, on the basis of criteria spelled out by them in self-management agreements. Income realized in a basic organization of associated labour shall provide the economic foundations for the rights of the workers to decide on the conditions of their labour and the distribution of income, and to earn personal incomes.
Article 18

The part of income which is the result of work under exceptionally favourable natural conditions or which is the result of exceptional privileges on

the market or of any other exceptional privileges in income earning, shall be used, in line with selfmanagement agreements and statute, for the development of the organization of associated labour in which this income has been realized, or for the development of the economic foundations of associated labour in the Commune, Republic or Autonomous Province concerned. The administration of the part of income used for the development of the economic foundations of associated labour in the Commune, Republic or the Autonomous Province, shall be based on the principles of self-management. Article 19 Workers in a basic organizations of associated labour shall allocate income to personal and collective consumption, the expansion of the economic foundations of associated labour, and the reserve fund. Workers shall allocate to personal and collective consumption a part of income which is proportionate to their contribution to the realization of this income made through their labour and the investment of social resources representing workers' past labour. Article 20 In line with the principle of distribution according to work performed and the rise in productivity of his own and total social labour, and in line with the principle of solidarity of workers in associated labour, every worker shall be entitled, from the income of his basic organization of associated labour, to a personal income for the satisfaction of his personal, common and general social needs, according to the results of his labour and his personal contribution made to the increase in the income of the basic organization with his current and past labour.
Article 21

Workers in a basic organization of associated labour shall lay down the fundamentals of and criteria for the allocation of resources for their personal incomes. Workers in a basic organization of associated labour shall, together with workers in other organizations of associated labour, determine the common foundations of and criteria for the distribution of income and the allocation of resources for personal incomes.

Should the distribution of income or the allocation of resources for personal incomes disrupt relations corresponding to the principle of distribution according to work performed or upset the course of social reproduction, measures may be introduced by statute to ensure the equality of workers in the application of the principle of distribution according to work performed, or to prevent or eliminate disruption in social reproduction.
Article 22

Every worker in associated labour working with social resources shall be guaranteed the right to a personal income and other rights stemming from labour to an amount and volume that ensure his economic and social security. The level of his guaranteed personal income and the volume of other guaranteed rights, and the manner of their realization, shall be determined by self-management agreements, social compacts and statute, depending on the general level of productivity of total social labour and on the general conditions prevailing in the environment in which the worker lives.
Article 23 A temporary restriction on the use by workers in basic organizations of associated labour of a part

of means of social reproduction, or an obligation to pool part of these means to finance specific indispensable needs of social reproduction may be introduced by statute, under conditions specified by the constitution. The obligatory pooling of part of the means of social reproduction may not lastingly deprive workers in basic organizations of associated labour of their rights concerning these means.
Article 24

Organizations of associated labour and social artificial persons shall be liable for their obligations with the social resources they manage.
Article 25

The rights of organizations of associated labour and other social artificial persons regarding real property, individual movables and other rights in social ownership may, against adequate compensation and by a procedure specified by statute, be appropriated or restricted only if this is required

by statutorily-determined needs of spatial planning or the construction of projects of social significance, or by some other general interest specified by statute. For rights to land or other natural resources thus appropriated the organization of associated labour or other social artificial person concerned shall only be entitled to compensation for the labour and resources invested in this land or other natural resources. If the land or other natural resources concerned are conditions of labour, the organization of associated labour or other social artificial person shall he entitled to compensation which will ensure that these conditions do not deteriorate.
Article 26

Workers in a basic organization of associated labour which in its activity makes use of the resources of other organizations of associated labour, which are on that account entitled to a share in jointly earned income, must, within the framework of income thus earned, be ensured resources for their personal and collective consumption in line with the common foundations and criteria in force in organizations of associated labour, and also to resources for the expansion of the economic foundations of labour according to their contribution to the jointly earned income. Criteria for determining the contribution to the jointly earned income shall be laid down by selfmanagement agreements, in line with uniform principles concerning the pooling of resources, as spelled out by federal statute. Organizations of associated labour which pool resources may not on this ground acquire any lasting right to a share in the income of the organization of associated labour which in its operations makes use of these resources. The right to a share in jointly earned income on account of the pooling of resources shall cease when, in addition to an adequate share in the jointly earned income the organization of associated labour has also been returned the resources through the pooling of which this right was acquired, or, when in conformity with the selfmanagement agreement, the right to the restitution of resources has ceased to exist.
Article 27

Organizations of associated labour may, under conditions and within the limits laid down by federal statute, use resources of foreign persons for the conduct of their business.

Workers in organizations of associated labour which make use of resources invested by foreign persons shall have the same socio-economic and other self-management rights as workers in the organizations of associated labour which in their operations use resources of other domestic organizations of associated labour. A foreign person who has invested resources in an organization of associated labour in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia may share in the income of this organization only within the limits and under conditions prescribed for mutual relations among domestic organizations of associated , labour.	 The rights of foreign persons to resources invested in an organization of associated labour in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia may not be restricted by statute or another enactment after the contract from which these rights stem has become legally valid. Article 28 In order to expand the economic foundations of labour, organizations of associated labour may collect financial resources from citizens and ensure them in addition to the repayment of these resources, compensation for investment in the form of interest or other benefits determined by statute. Article 29 Workers who in an organization of associated labour perform administrative-professional, auxiliary and similar activities of common interest to several organizations operating within it, and workers who perform such activities in an agricultural or other kind of cooperative, and also workers in an organization of a business association, bank or insurance community, shall form a work community. Workers in such a work community may organize themselves into an organization of associated labour under conditions specified by statute. Workers who in an organization of associated labour perform other activities of common interest to several organizations operating within it, and workers who perform such activities on behalf of an agricultural or other kind of cooperative, shall form a work community if there are no constitutionally-determined conditions for them to organize themselves into a basic organization of associated labour. Workers in such work communities shall be entitled to resources for their personal and collective consumption in line with the principle of

distribution according to work performed and in line with the fundamentals and criteria applicable in organizations of associated labour, and also to other self-management rights of workers in organizations of associated labour in line with the nature of activities they perform and with the common interests for the purpose of which these work communities have been formed. The mutual rights, obligations and responsibilities of workers in such work communities and of beneficiaries of their services shall be regulated by self-management agreements, and mutual relations among workers in such work communities shall be regulated by their self-management enactments in conformity with self-management agreements.
Article 30

Workers in work communities which perform activities on behalf of self-managing communities of interest and of other self-managing organizations and communities and their associations, socio-political organizations and other social organizations, associations of citizens and agencies of the sociopolitical communities, shall be entitled to resources for personal and collective consumption in line with the principle of distribution according to work performed and with socially-determined fundamentals and criteria applicable to organizations of associated labour. They shall also have other self-management rights in conformity with the nature of activities they perform and the social and political responsibility of the organizations, communities and agencies on whose behalf they perform these activities — for the purpose of realization of their functions and tasks. The mutual rights, duties and responsibilities of workers in such work communities and organizations, communities and agencies on whose behalf they perform activities, shall be regulated by selfmanagement agreements or by contract, in conformity with statute. The rights, powers and responsibilities of organizations, communities and agencies may not be transferred to the work communities which perform activities on their behalf. The rights, obligations and responsibilities of workers in work communities of the agencies of socio-economic communities shall be regulated by statute, and when this is allowed by the nature of activity of the agency concerned — also by selfmanagement agreements or by contracts entered into between the work communities and these agencies and by self-management enactments of the work communities.

Active military personnel and civil persons serving in the Armed Forces of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall realize corresponding rights in conformity with federal statute, in line with the nature of activities and character of the Armed Forces.
Article 31

Working people who with their personal labour independently perform, as their occupation, an artistic or other cultural activity or a legal or other professional activity shall, in principle, have the same socio-economic status and basically the same rights and obligations as workers in organizations of associated labour. Working people performing some of these activities may pool their labour and form temporary or lasting work communities, which shall basically have the same status as organizations of associated labour and in which the working people shall basically have the same rights and duties as workers in organization of associated labour. Conditions under which these working people and their work communities realize their rights and fulfil their obligations, and the conditions under which in performing these activities they may make use of and manage social resources, shall be specified by statute. The way in which these working people will cooperate with organizations of associated labour, and the manner of their participation in the creation of conditions for work in these organizations and in the use of the results of their labour expressed as jointly realized income, shall also be specified by statute.
Article 32

Workers in organizations of associated labour shall, in line with the principles of reciprocity and solidarity, jointly and on an equal footing ensure continuous improvement in the living conditions of workers by allocating and pooling resources for this purpose, and in other ways. Organizations of associated labour and socio-political communities shall be bound, in conformity with the principles of reciprocity and solidarity, to provide economic and other kinds of assistance to organizations of associated labour which have run into exceptional economic difficulties, and to take measures for their financial rehabilitation, if this is in the common interest of the organizations of associated labour, or in the social interest. An organization of associated labour, alone or in

agreement with other organizations of associated labour, shall, in keeping with the principles of reciprocity and solidarity, ensure resources for the employment, retraining and the realization of the acquired rights of workers, if their work is no longer needed in their organization of associated labour, or if an organization operating within it has ceased to operate. Until he has been ensured an appropriate job which corresponds to his abilities and qualifications, no worker may lose the status of worker in a basic organization of associated labour if, due to technological or other kinds of innovation which contribute to the rise in labour productivity or to a greater success of the organization, his work is no longer needed in this organization. An obligation to pool resources for these purposes and for employment in general may be introduced by statute and conditions for using these resources regulated by it. Article 33 Workers in associated labour shall contribute to the satisfaction of constitutionally-determined general social needs in the socio-political communities by paying taxes and other dues to these communities on the income of their basic organizations of associated labour and on their personal incomes, in line with the purpose or aims which the resources collected through such taxes and dues serve. The obligation to pay taxes and other dues to the socio-political communities shall be determined in accordance with the ability of the economy to ensure, in line with the level of productivity of social labour as a whole and in conformity with the requirements of material and social development which correspond to the economy's possibilities and to the long-term interests of the d evelopment of the productive forces of society, the satisfaction of the personal and common needs of the workers and the requirements of expanded reproduction. These obligations shall be spelled out in accordance with the ability of organizations of associated labour to secure, in line with the general obligations of the economy, the results of their labour and the business success achieved by them, the satisfaction of these needs. These principles shall also apply if the sociopolitical communities with their enactments impose some temporary restriction on the use of resources managed by workers in organizations of associated labour or introduce an obligation to pool such resources.

2. Pooling of Labour and Means of Social Reproduction Article 34 Workers in basic organizations of associated labour shall freely pool their labour and means of social reproduction in work organizations and in other forms of the pooling of labour and resources. Mutual rights, obligations and responsibilities stemming from various forms of the pooling of labour and resources shall be regulated by workers in basic organizations of associated labour through self-management agreements in conformity with statute, ensuring within the totality of these relations the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of the workers. Article 35 A work organization is an independent selfmanaging organization of workers linked in labour by common interests and organized in basic organizations of associated labour of which the work organization is composed, or of workers directly linked together through the unity of the labour process. A work organization may be founded by organizations of associated labour, self-managing communities of interest, local communities, socio-political communities and other social artificial persons. A work organization may, under conditions and in the way specified by statute, be founded by working people with a view to realizing their right to work or to satisfying their needs with the products and services of the organization they are founding. A work organization may, in conformity with statute, also be founded by civil artificial persons. Working people or civil artificial persons who have invested their resources in an organization of associated labour which they have founded, may in respect of this organization have, on account of these resources, only those rights which are vested in citizens from whom organizations of associated labour collect resources to expand the economic foundations of their labour. It may be laid down by statute that working people and civil artificial persons may not found work organizations in charge of the performance of specific activities. Work organizations shall have the same status and workers in them the same socio-economic and other self-managing rights and responsibilities,

regardless of who has founded the work organization concerned. Article 36 Workers in a unit of a work organization which makes up a working whole in which the results of their joint labour can be expressed in terms of value within the work organization or on the market, and in which the workers can realize their socio-economic and other self-management rights, shall have the right and duty to organize such a unit of the work organization as a basic organization of associated labour. Workers in a work organization which does not have conditions for its individual units to be organized as basic organizations of associated labour, shall in their work organization enjoy all rights vested in workers in basic organizations of associated labour. Socio-economic and other self-management relations in a basic organization of associated labour shall be regulated by its by-laws and other selfmanagement enactments, in line with the constitution and statute. If in connection with the formation of a basic organization of associated labour a dispute has arisen, until the settlement of this dispute the rights, obligations and responsibilities which the workers had before the settlement of the dispute may not be changed against their will. Article 37 Workers in a basic organization of associated labour shall have the right to have their basic organization split away from the work organization of which it is a part. A basic organization of associated labour which thus splits off shall be bound, in agreement with other basic organizations of associated labour and the work organization as a whole, to regulate the way and terms of fulfilment of its obligations towards them which it undertook prior to the split, and to make good any losses caused by the split. Workers may not split their basic organization of associated labour off from the work organization of which it is a part is this should, contrary to the general interest, lead to a major hindrance or prevention of work in other basic organizations making part of the work organization or in the work organization as a whole. Article 38 Workers in basic organizations of associated

labour may associate in various forms of composite organizations of associated labour, and basic organizations of associated labour and work organizations also in other forms of integration of organizations of associated labour in which they pursue specific common interests. Obligatory integration of specific kinds of organizations of associated labour in communities which, in the general interest, ensure the unity of the system of work in appropriate spheres may, under conditions specified by the constitution, be introduced by statute or by a decision of the sociopolitical community based on statutory authority.

Article 39

Organizations of associated labour, self-managing communities of interest and other social artificial persons may by self-management agreements found a bank as a special organization in charge of the conduct of credit and other bank activities, and pool in it, together with other persons, resources with a view to pursuing common interests regarding provision of funds for the performance, expansion and promotion of the activities of the organizations of associated labour and other selfmanaging organizations and communities, and with a view to pursuing other common interests. Social artificial persons with whose resources such a bank operates, shall manage the bank's business. The income realized by the bank, after operational costs have been covered and allocations made for the work community of the bank, shall be distributed among these artificial persons. Social artificial persons shall have the right to manage specific affairs of the bank in the department of the bank which operates with their resources. No socio-political community may found a bank nor manage the affairs of one. Mutual relations among social artificial persons whose resources are used by the bank in its operations, the management of the bank and its business shall be regulated by the self-management agreement on the founding of the bank, its by-laws and statute.
Article 40

The business activities of financial organizations founded for operating savings accounts and the management of such organizations, and also the management of the operations of banks concerning savings accounts, shall be regulated by statute in

line with the uniform principles of the credit system. The rights of citizens to take part, on account of their savings accounts, in the management of operations of these financial organizations and to enjoy, in addition to stipulated interest, other benefits, shall be regulated by statute. Article 41 Organizations of associated labour, self-managing communities of interest and other social artificial persons shall in organizations of associated labour which, besides other activities engage in banking and similar business, in principle, have the same rights in respect of this business as social artificial persons have in a bank which operates with their resources. If internal banking or similar operations are organized in an organization of associated labour, these operations shall be governed by the principles applying to banking operations. Article
42

Organizations of associated labour, self-managing communities of interest, socio-political communities and other social artificial persons may by self-management agreement found a community of life and property insurance for the same, related or different risks or losses, or for several different kinds of risk or loss, and may pool in it, together with other persons, on principles of reciprocity and solidarity, resources for life and property insurance and for the purpose of eliminating or lessening the unfavourable effects of such losses. In an insurance community in which resources have been pooled for the purpose of life and property insurance against various kinds of risk or loss, insurees who pool resources to insure themselves against the same or related kinds of risk or loss shall form separate risk communities and shall pool resources in separate insurance funds covering these losses. Insurees in risk communities shall, in agreement with other insurees in the same insurance community, lay down under what conditions the assets of the funds earmarked for the settlement of damages for one kind of loss may be used for the settlement od damages for another kind of loss. Social artificial persons who pool resources in an insurance community or a risk community, shall manage the business of this community. Mutual relations among social artificial persons who have pooled resources in an insurance corn-

munity, the management of this community and its operations shall be regulated by the self-management agreement on the founding of the community, its by-laws or other self-management enactment, and by statute. Citizens and civil artificial persons — insurees shall participate in the management of their respective insurance communities or risk communities, and shall have other rights in them in conformity with their by-laws and statute. Article 43 Relations between organizations of associated labour engaged in the sale of goods and services and productive and other organizations with which they do business shall be based on the principles of cooperations and self-management pooling of labour and resources within the framework of this cooperation. These organizations shall, on a basis of equality, exercise a mutual influence on business and development policies, bear joint risks and joint responsibility for the expansion of the economic foundations of labour and the rise in labour productivity in production and trade, and shall share in the income earned through this cooperation according to their contribution to the realization of this income. Organizations of associated labour which engage in the export and import trade and operate on the principle of obligatory cooperation with productive and other organizations of associated labour on behalf of which they carry out export and import operations and which within the framework of this cooperation formulate a joint policy of production and/or other activities, and export-import policy, shall distribute income earned through this cooperation as their joint income, and shall jointly share the risk of their business and responsibility for promoting production and trade, in conformity with self-managing agreement or contract on this cooperation. It shall be regulate by federal statute in which cases and under what conditions organizations of associated labour engaging in export-import, wholesale and retail trade and in other statutorilydefined trading activities shall be bound to pool their labour and resources with productive and other organizations of associated labour with which they do business. The manner and form of pooling labour and resources, the way of deciding on joint business operations, joint risk bearing and the determination of principles of distribution of jointly earned income shall be regulated by federal statute.

Organizations of associated labour engaged in the sale of consumer goods and services shall be bound, in the way specified by statute, to cooperate and conclude agreements with self-managing communities of interest, local communities and other communities and consumer organizations regarding affairs of common concern. Article 44 Organizations of associated labour may carry out their activities and invest the means of social reproduction abroad, under conditions and within the limits laid down by federal statute. Rights and resources acquired abroad on any ground by an organization of associated labour shall become a component part of the social resources managed by the workers of this organization. Workers in an organization of associated labour operating abroad shall have the same rights, obligations and responsibilities as the workers of this organization working in Yugoslavia. Article 45 Basic and other organizations of associated labour, their communities, and other forms of organizations of associated labour, banks, communities of life and property insurance, and other financial organizations shall be artificial persons vested with the rights, obligations and responsibilities, spelled out by the constitution, statute, self-management agreements on association or the enactments on their founding. These organizations communities and associations and their rights, obligations and responsibilities shall be entered into a register. Article 46 Against organizations of associated labour, their communities or other associations of these organizations in which the realization of workers' selfmanagement rights has been substantially disrupted, or which do not fulfil their statutory obligations or have caused serious damage to social interests, temporary measures specified by statute may be taken under conditions and by a procedure provided for by statute. If this is necessary in order to prevent such practices, the realization of individual self-management rights of the workers and/or of organizations or associations and their bodies may be temporarily restricted by these measures.

Article 47

If a dispute arises in an organization of associated labour between workers in individual units of the organization, or between the workers and bodies of the organization, or the workers of the organization and an agency of a socio-political community, which it has not been possible to settle by regular proceedings, the workers shall have the right and duty to present their demands, stemming from the dispute through their trade union organization. The competent trade union organization shall have the right and duty, on the request of workers, or on its own initiative, to institute proceedings for the settlement of the dispute and in these procedings, together with the appropriate managing bodies of the organization of associated labour concerned, or with the agencies of the socio-political community concerned, to lay down the basic principles and criteria for the solution of the question that has caused the dispute.
Article 48

Organizations of associated labour and/or organizations of business associations which engage in economic activities may, under conditions and by a procedure laid down by federal statute, be wound up if they do not fulfil statutory conditions for the performance of their activities, if for a prolonged time they are not able to renew the social resources with which they operate and to ensure the realization of the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of workers concerning their economic and social security, or if they are not in a position to fulfil other statutory or contractual obligations. Organizations of associated labour which perform social activities may be wound up, under conditions and by a procedure specified by statute, if they do not meet the conditions spelled out by statute or if the conditions for the performance of their activities do not exist.
Article 49

It may be laid down by statute and a decision of the assembly of the socio-political community made on statutory authority that specific activities or affairs of organizations of associated labour which perform social activites shall be treated as being of special social interest; the mode of realization of this special social interest and the realization of workers' self-management rights in line with this interest may at the same time be regulated by this statute and decision.

If so required by a special social interest, the mode of realization of this interest in the activity of organizations of associated labour which carry out economic activities may be regulated by statute and a decision of the assembly of the socio-political community made on statutory authority, when these activities are an irreplaceable condition of the life and work of citizens or of the work of other organizations in a specific field. Article 50 Organizations of associated labour which carry out economic activities and their business associations shall associate in chambers of economy or other general associations with a view jointly to promoting work and business, adjusting special, common and general social interests, reaching agreement on working and development plans and programmes and on the self-management regulation of socio-economic relations, initiating selfmanagement agreements and social compacts, adopting legislation and formulating economic policy, and with a view to considering and resolving other questions of common concern. In order to realize these aims, organizations of associated labour performing social activities may also form associations for individual activities or for individual spheres of work, as well as other general associations.

3. Sell-Managing Communities of Interest Article 51 Self-managing communities of interest shall be formed by working people, directly or through their self-managing organizations and communities, to satisfy their personal and common needs and interests and to adjust work in the spheres for which the communities of interest are being created to these needs and interests. The rights, obligations and responsibilities in mutual relations in a self-managing community of interest shall be regulated by its founding selfmanagement agreement, by its by-laws, and by other self-management enactments. To satisfy their needs and interests in selfmanaging communities of interest, working people shall pay contributions to these communities from their personal incomes and from the income of basic organizations of associated labour, in line with the purpose or aims for which these resources are to be used.

Article 32 Workers and other working people who in the fields of education, science, culture, health and social welfare realize, on the principles of reciprocity and solidarity, their personal and common needs and interests, and workers in organizations of associated labour which carry out activities in these fields, shall form self-managing communities of interest in which they shall freely exchange labour, pool labour and resources and shall jointly and on equal terms decide on the performance of these activities in line with common interests, shape the policy concerning the development and promotion of these activities, and realize other common interests. Mutual relations in such self-managing communities of interest shall be regulated so as to secure the rights of the workers and other working people who have pooled resources in them to decide on these resources, and also the rights of the workers in organizations of associated labour which perform activities in the field for which a particular community of interest has been formed to realize through free exchange of labour the same socio-economic status as workers in other organizations of associated labour. Self-managing communities of interest may also be formed on such foundations in other fields of social activity. Article 53 In order to ensure their social security working people shall form self-managing communities of interest in the fields of pension and disability insurance and other forms of social security, in which they will pool resources for the purpose and determine, on the principles of reciprocity and solidarity and past labour, their common and individual obligations towards these communities and the common and individual rights they will realize in them. Self-managing communities of interest may also be formed on such foundations in other fields in which through the pooling of resources into joint funds specific common interests will be realized on the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. Article 54 Working people, directly or through their organizations of associated labour and other self-managing organizations and communities, shall form self-managing communities of interest in the housing sector, in which these organizations and corn-

munities shall pool resources for housing construction, formulate housing construction policy and programmes, and together with tenants manage residential buildings and dwellings in social ownership, and shall realize other common interests. Federal legislation may provide for the formation of special communities of interest for housing construction and management of dwellings for the needs of active military personnel and civilian persons serving in the Armed Forces of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and also for the needs of workers and officials of federal agencies. Article 55 In the fields of communal activities, power production, water management, transport and other activities in the sphere of material production, if the permanent performance of these activities is indispensable for the satisfaction of the needs of specific beneficiaries, self-managing communities of interest of organizations of associated labour in these fields and of beneficiaries of their products and services may be formed in which they will realize common interests specified by self-management agreement. Article 56 In order to ensure the most direct possible realization of their self-management rights and interests, workers and other working people and their organizations of associated labour and other selfmanaging organizations and communities — members of a self-managing community of interest, shall have the right, within this community of interest, under conditions specified by the selfmanagement agreement on the formation of the self-managing community of interest or by its by-laws, to organize themselves into a basic community or unit for a specific sphere or for the realization of specific common interests, and to realize in this basic community or unit their specific self-management rights and interests. Self-managing communities of interest may combine into broader communities of interest and form federations and other association of communities of interest, and also set up other forms of mutual cooperation. When a self-managing community of interest is being formed for an area wider than the territory of a Commune, communities may be set up for the territories of several Communes as parts of this self-managing community of interest.

stitutional courts, respectively, which shall only assess the conformity of this regulation or enactment to the republican constitution or the provincial constitution, or to the republican, provincial or federal statute whose enforcement falls within the competence of agencies in the Republics and Autonomous Provinces. If the republican or the provincial constitutional court rules that a regulation or enactment conforms to the republican constitution and the provincial constitution, respectively, or to the federal statute whose enforcement falls within the competence of agencies in the Republics and Autonomous Provinces, it shall refer the case to the Constitutional Court of Yugoslavia to assess the conformity of the regulation or enactment with the S.
