The Nicaraguan people; the democratic, patriotic and revolutionary political parties and organizations of Nicaragua; the men and women; the workers and peasants; the glorious youth; the heroic mothers; those Christians who moved by their faith in GOD committed and dedicated themselves to the struggle for the liberation of the oppressed; the patriotic intellectuals; and all others who through their productive labor contribute to the defense of the Nation; Those who guarantee the happiness of future generations by offering their lives in the struggle against imperialist aggression; FOR The establishment of the legal framework to protect and preserve the achievements of the Revolution and the building of a new society dedicated to the elimination of all forms of exploitation and to the achievement of economic, political and social equality for all Nicaraguans and absolute respect for human rights.

Fundamental Principles
Art. 1 Independence, sovereignty and self-determination are inalienable rights of the Nicaraguan people and the foundation of the Nicaraguan nation. Any foreign interference in the internal affairs of Nicaragua or any attempt to undermine these rights is an attack upon the life of the people. It is the right of the people and the duty of all citizens to preserve and defend, with arms if necessary, the independence of the Nation, its sovereignty and national self-determination. Art.2 National sovereignty rests with the people, the source of all power and forgers of their own destiny. The people exercise democracy by freely deciding upon and participating in the construction of the economic, political and social system which best serves their interests. The people exercise power both directly and through their representatives elected by universal suffrage; equal, free and direct elections and secret ballot. The struggle for peace and the establishment of a just world order are unrenounceable national commitments of the Nicaraguan nation. We, therefore, oppose all forms of colonialist and imperialist domination and exploitation. The Nicaraguan people are in solidarity with all those who struggle against oppression and discrimination. The Nicaraguan people have created a new state to promote their interests and guarantee their social and political achievements. The state is the principal instrument through which the people eliminate all forms of exploitation and oppression, promote material and spiritual progress of the nation, and ensure that the interests and rights of the majority prevail. The state guarantees the existence of political pluralism, a mixed economy and non-alignment Political pluralism assures the existence and participation of all political organizations in the economic, political and social affairs of the nation, without ideological restrictions, except for those who seek a return to the past or advocate the establishment of a political system similar to it A mixed economy assures the existence of different forms of property: public, private, associative, cooperative and communal; these forms of property must serve the best interests of the nation and contribute to the creation of wealth to satisfy the needs of the country and its inhabitants. Nicaragua's international relations are based on the principle of nonalignment, the search for peace, and respect for the sovereignty of all nations; therefore, Nicaragua opposes all forms of discrimination and is anticolonialist anti-imperialist and anti-racist Nicaragua rejects the subordination of any state by another.
