CONSTITUTION of the REPUBLIC OF GUATEVIALA I
September 15, 1965 Invoking the protection of God, for the Greatness and good of our homeland, with faith in the principles of the democratic system of government, we, as representatives of the Guatemalan people, meeting in a National Constituent Assembly, carrying out the special mandate for which we were elected and exercising the sovereign powers with which we are vested, do solemnly decree and ratify the following
CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC

TITLE I THE NATION, THE STATE AND ITS GOVERNMENT
CHAPTER I. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Art. 1. Guatemala is a free, sovereign, and independent nation, established for the purpose of guaranteeing to its inhabitants the enjoyment of freedom, security and justice. Its system of government is republican, democratic and representative. It delegates its sovereignty to the legislative, executive and judicial branches, which are not subordinate one to the other. No person, group, or entity may usurp the sovereignty of the nation. Art. 2. Guatemala, as a part of the Central American community, shall maintain and cultivate fraternal relations of co-operation and solidarity with the other states that formed the Federation and, loyal to the patriotic ideal which inspired it, shall take all just and peaceful measures that may lead to a full or partial realization of the union of Central America.

Art. 3. Guatemala exercises full sovereignty and dominion over its territory which includes soil, subsoil, continental shelf, territorial waters, and the space above these, and the natural resources and wealth exisitng therein, without prejudice to free navigation by sea and air in conformity with law and the provisions of international treaties and agreements. Art. 4. Spanish is the official language.

CHAPTER II. NATIONALITY

Art. 5. The following are native Guatemalans:

1. Persons born in Guatemalan territory or on board Guatemalan vessels and aircraft, whether of a Guatemalan father or mother, of unidentified parents or of parents of nationality unknown. 2. Persons born in Guatemala of foreign parents if either of them is domiciled in the Republic. Persons born in Guatemala of transient alien parents if upon reaching their majority, they establish domicile in Guatemala and declare their desire to be Guatemalans. Children of diplomatic representatives or of persons holding comparable posts by domestic or international law are excepted. 3. Persons born outside the territory of the Republic of a native Guatemalan father and mother in the following cases: (a) If they establish domicile in the country; (b) If under the laws of the place of their birth, the foreign nationality of their birthplace is not attributed to them; (c) If, having the right to choose, they opt for Guatemalan nationality. 4. Persons born outside the territory of the Republic of a native Guatemalan father or mother or those to whom this status corresponds, if they establish a domicile in Guatemala and opt for Guatemalan nationality; and those included, in the cases referred to in (b) and (c) of the preceding section. 5. Persons born abroad of a Guatemalan father or mother who are outside the national territory by reason of rendering services to the Republic. To opt for Guatemalan nationality implies a renunciation of any other nationality, except a Central American nationality, which condition must be expressly recorded. Art. 6. Native-born nationals of the other Republics that constituted the Federation of Central America are also considered to be native Guatemalans provided they acquire domicile in Guatemala and declare their desire to be Guatemalans before the appropriate authority. In this event, they may preserve their nationality of origin. The preceding paragraph is without prejudice to whatever may be established in bilateral or multilateral Central American agreements.

Art. 7. The following are Guatemalans by naturalization: 1. Aliens who have obtained a naturalization certificate in accordance with the law. 2. Aliens who, having had their domicile and residence in Guatemala for the period of time established by law, obtain a naturalization certificate. 3.

Alien minors adopted by a Guatemalan, who shall have the right to opt for the nationality of origin corresponding to them within one year after attaining majority. 6. Minor children of a naturalized Guatemalan, born abroad, who shall have the right of option indicated in the preceding section, upon attaining majority. 7. Spaniards and Latin Americans by birth who are domiciled in the country and declare their desire to be Guatemalans before a competent authority. Naturalized Guatemalans shall be subject to no limitations other than those deriving from this Constitution and those applicable by law to all Guatemalans. Art. 8. Persons to whom Guatemalan nationality is granted must expressly renounce any other nationality and take an oath of allegiance to Guatemala and obedience to the Constitution. Art. 9. Guatemalan nationality is lost : 1. By naturalization in a foreign country, except in a Central American country. 2. If a naturalized Guatemalan resides for three or more consecutive years outside the territory of Central America, except in cases of force majeure and those provided for by law or by international treaties. 3. If a naturalized Guatemalan commits the crime of treason against the country; or by repudiating the status of Guatemalan in any authentic document or public instrument or by voluntary use of a foreign passport. 4. By revocation of the naturalization, by due process of law. Legal defenses may be interposed against the decision. Art. 10. Guatemalan nationality may be recovered: 1. By native Guatemalans who lost it by naturalization in a foreign country, if they establish domicile in Guatemala, except where the naturalization was acquired by marriage. 2. By persons who, having had the right to choose, opted for a nation-

ality other than Guatemalan, if they establish domicile in Guatemala and declare their desire to be Guatemalans. 3. By dissolution of marriage bonds when naturalization in a foreign country has resulted from marriage, provided that the person concerned declares his desire to recover Guatemalan nationality; and even without such declaration, if the foreign nationality has been lost through dissolution of the marriage.

Art. 23. From the moment a candidate is nominated, he enjoys personal immunity, and may be arrested and tried only if it is found that there are grounds for a case against him. Exception to the foregoing is made in case of a crime detected in the act of commission. The Electoral Law shall determine who is competent to make the decision, as the case may be. Art. 24. Minorities that are numerically determinable shall be entitled to representation on all bodies chosen by popular election. The law shall regulate the technical system that is to be adopted. Art. 25. The law shall prescribe rules for the exercise of suffrage in order to guarantee its freedom and honesty, so that it may constitute a true expression of the popular will. Art. 26. Provisions amending the Electoral Law, adopted after an election has been called and before the result is known or the persons elected have assumed office, shall not be applicable to that election.

CHAPTER V. POLITICAL PARTIES

Art. 27. The state guarantees the free formation and functioning of political parties that have democratic standards and principles. The formation of parties or entities is prohibited if they advocate the communist ideology or if their doctrinary tendency, methods of action, or international connections threaten the sovereignty of the state or the foundations of the democratic organization of Guatemala. Art. 28. Only entities formed by a minimum of fifty thousand members with rights of citizenship and inscribed in the electoral register may be registered as political parties.

Art. 32. Action taken to force a person to join a political party against his will, to remain in one or to resign, is punishable. If the one responsible is a public official or employee of a municipality or a state agency, his citizenship rights shall be suspended and he shall be barred from holding public office for such time as the law may specify. Art. 33. Any activity in favor of the reelection of the person occupying the presidency of the Republic, or in any other way intended to prolong the term fixed by the Constitution for that office, or of violating the principle of rotation and non-reelection for the presidency, is subject to punishment.
CHAPTER VI. ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES

TITLE II CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES
CHAPTER I. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES

Art. 43. In Guatemala all human beings are free and equal in dignity and rights. The state guarantees as rights inherent in the human person: life, corporeal integrity, dignity, personal security and that of his property. No person may be subjected to servitude or to any other condition that impairs his dignity or respect. Any discrimination because of race, color, sex, religion, birth, economic or social position or political opinions is prohibited. Art. 44. The free exercise of the rights established by the Constitution is guaranteed with no limitations other than those deriving from the necessity of maintaining the public and social order. Art. 45. Every person has the right to do whatever the law does not prohibit. No person is required to comply with or obey orders or mandates which are not based on law. No person may be persecuted or molested for his opinions or for acts which do not involve an infraction of the law. Any act that hinders or restricts Guatemalans from exercising their rights and fulfilling their duties as citizens is punishable, with the exception of restrictions established by the Constitution.

Art. 46. No person may be arrested or imprisoned except for a crime or misdemeanor and by virtue of a writ or warrant issued pursuant to law by the appropriate judicial authority. A prior warrant shall not be necessary when a person is discovered in the act of committing a crime or in the case of a fugitive from justice. Persons under arrest must be immediately placed at the disposal of the judicial authority and confined in places of temporary detention separate from those provided for the purpose of serving a sentence. Art. 47. Persons whose identity and trustworthiness can be established by means of documents, through testimony of persons of known standing, or by the appropriate authority must not be detained for minor offenses or for infractions of regulations. In such cases the authority involved, under pain of appropriate sanction, must limit his action to informing the proper judge of the act committed and to warning the offender to appear before the court within the following forty-eight business hours. Those who disobey the summons shall be punished in accordance with the law. Persons who are unable to identify themselves in accordance with the foregoing paragraph shall be placed at the disposal of the proper judge for judgment within one business hour after the time of arrest. The hours from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. every day of the year shall be considered business hours for this purpose. Art. 48. A law has no retroactive effect, except in criminal matters when favorable to the guilty party. Art. 49. Actions or omissions which are not crimes or misdemeanors punishable by a law enacted prior to their perpetration are not punishable. Any individual or group action of a communist or anarchist nature or contrary to democracy is punishable. The law shall govern matters relating to this class of crimes. There shall be no imprisonment for debt. The penalty of confinamiento (confinement to a certain place with freedom to move about therein but under the surveillance of the authorities) may not be imposed. Art. 50. No person may be compelled in a criminal case to testify against himself, against his spouse, or against relatives within the fourth degree of consanguinity or second degree of affinity. Art. 51. Every person arrested shall be interrogated within forty-eight hours. At the time of this questioning, the reason for the detention, the name of the accuser or denouncer, and any other facts necessary for a knowledge of the alleged punishable act are to be made known. From the time of this proceeding, the accused may avail himself of legal counsel, who shall have the right to be present at the hearing and to visit the defendant at any time during office hours. Preventive arrest may not exceed five days. Within this period an order

of imprisonment must be issued or the arrested person must be set free. A judge who prolongs this period will be held responsible. Any authority, prison head or employee who holds or orders the holding of a person incommunicado shall be removed from his position, without prejudice to the imposition of other penalties prescribed by law. Art. 52. No writ of imprisonment may be issued unless preceded by information that a crime has been committed and unless there are sufficient grounds for belief that the person under arrest has committed it or participated in it. Art. 53. Defense of one's person and of one's rights is inviolable. No one may be tried by a commission or by special courts. No one may be sentenced without having been charged, heard, and convicted in a legal trial held before competent and previously established courts or authorities, at which the essential formalities and guarantees have been observed; likewise, no one may be temporarily deprived of his rights except by virtue of proceedings which meet the same requirements. Art. 54. The death penalty shall be considered extraordinary. It may not be imposed on the basis of presumptions, nor shall it apply to women or minors, to persons over seventy years of age, to persons guilty of political crimes, or to persons whose extradition has been granted under that condition. All existing legal recourses are admissible against a sentence imposing the death penalty, including cassation and clemency (gracia). These two recourses shall not be admissible in the event of invasion of the territory, siege of a fort or city, or mobilization for war. The penalty is to be carried out after all recourses have been exhausted. Art. 55. The prison system shall encourage the reform and social readjustment of prisoners. Imprisonment is to be carried out only in establishments intended for the serving of sentences. Places of detention or for the serving of sentences are civilian centers. No arrested or imprisoned person shall be prevented from satisfying his natural functions. Nor shall physical or moral torture, cruel treatment, infamous punishment or acts, hardships, or coercion be inflicted, nor shall a person be compelled to perform work prejudicial to his health or incompatible with his physical constitution or his dignity, nor may he be made the victim of extortion. Minors must not be regarded as criminals and may never be sent to jails or establishments intended for adults, but should be attended to in suitable institutions under the care of qualified persons, for the purpose of obtaining a full education, medical and social assistance and their adjustment to society. The treatment of maladjusted minors and unprotected children shall be covered by a special law. Institutions suitable for carrying out the provisions of this article shall be established.

Art. 56. Public officials or employees who give orders contrary to the foregoing article, and subordinates who carry out such orders, shall be removed from their posts, be permanently barred from holding any public office or employment and shall receive the pertinent legal punishment. Heads of prisons and places of detention shall be responsible, as authors thereof, for any act of torture, cruel treatment, or infamous punishment in.. flicted on criminals or inmates in the establishment of which they are in charge, and even when it appears that a subordinate was directly responsible, they shall be punished as accomplices or concealers, unless immediately after the act became known they took the necessary steps to prevent or stop it and initiated proceedings against the authors. A guard who makes use of arms unnecessarily against an inmate or prisoner shall be held liable under criminal law. The action deriving from an offense committed under these circumstances is imprescriptible. Art. 57. The domicile is inviolable. No one may enter another person's home without permission of the occupant, except on the written order of a competent judge and never before 6 A.M. or after 6 P.M. The law shall set forth the formal requirements and excepted cases in which a home may broken into and whether on such an occasion documents and effects may be examined. Such examination shall always take place in the presence of the party concerned, his agent, or a member of the family of legal age, or in the absence thereof, in the presence of two witnesses who reside in the place and who have a reputation for being honest. Art. 58. The correspondence and private papers and books of any person are inviolable. They may be examined or seized only by virtue of an order issued by a competent judge in accordance with the law. By written order of a competent judge and in specific cases, authorities concerned with tax supervision also may examine and seize private papers and books that relate to the payment of taxes; in all cases the seizure or examination must take place in the presence of the party concerned or his agent, or in their absence, in the presence of a relative of legal age or of two reputable witnesses who are residents of the place. It is a punishable offense to reveal the amount or the source of funds from which taxes are derived, as well as profits, losses, costs, or any other data relating to taxpaying individuals or enterprises or to their accounting systems. Illegally seized documents and violated correspondence shall not be admissible in a trial. Art. 59. All persons are free to enter, remain in, travel through and leave the territory of the Republic except for the limitations established by law. No person may be compelled to change his residence or domicile except by order of a competent authority in accordance with the requirements prescribed by law. Art. 60. No Guatemalan may be expatriated, prohibited from entering

the territory of the Republic, or denied a passport or other documents of identification. Guatemalans may enter and leave the country without fulfilling visa requirements. The law shall determine the responsibility of those who violate this provision. Art. 61. Guatemala recognizes the right of asylum and extends it to political refugees who seek protection under its flag, provided they respect the sovereignty and the laws of the state. Extradition of political offenders is prohibited and in no case shall an attempt be made to extradite Guatemalans who for political reasons take refuge in a foreign country. No Guatemalan shall be handed over to a foreign government for trial or punishment except for crimes covered by international treaties in force in Guatemala. Extradition is also prohibited of persons accused of common crimes connected with political crimes. Whenever expulsion of a political refugee is ordered, he shall not be handed over to the country whose government pursues him. Art. 62. The inhabitants of the Republic have the right to address petitions, individually or collectively, to the authorities, and the latter are obligated to act upon them according to law without delay and to communicate their decisions to the persons concerned. Petitions regarding political matters may be made only by Guatemalans and must be acted upon within a period of not more than eight days. If the authority does not render a decision within that period the petition shall be deemed to have been denied and the interested party may have recourse to legal remedies. Petitions of other kinds addressed to administrative authorities must be acted upon within a period of not more than thirty days after pertinent administrative proceedings have been concluded. If this is not done the petitioner may have recourse to amparo in order to fix a final period for decision by the authority concerned. The Armed Forces may neither debate nor exercise the rights of petition and suffrage. Art. 63. The right of peaceful assembly without arms is recognized. The right of assembly and of public demonstration may not be restricted, limited, or restrained and the law shall regulate these rights for the sole purpose of guaranteeing public order. Religious processions outside of churches are permitted and are governed by law. Art. 64. The inhabitants of the Republic have the right to associate freely for the various objectives of human life, for the purpose of promoting, exercising and protecting their rights and interests, especially those established by the Constitution.

The organization or operation of groups that function in accordance with or subordinate to international organizations advocating the communist ideology or any other totalitarian system is prohibited. Art. 65. Thoughts may be freely expressed without prior censorship. Any person who abuses this right by acting with a disregard for private life or morality shall be held responsible before the law. Denunciation, criticism, or censure directed against public officials or employees for strictly official acts committed in the course of their duties do not constitute the offenses of libel and slander. Persons who deem themselves offended are entitled to have their defenses and corrections published. Public officials and employees may demand that a court of honor, set up as prescribed by law, declare that the publication that affects them is based on incorrect information or that the charges made against them are unfounded. A decision that vindicates the person offended must be published in the same organ of the press in which the offensive publication appeared. Public officials or employees may not be members of that court. Printing shops, radio-broadcasting and television stations and any other media of expression may not be confiscated or seized, attached, or closed, or their work interrupted, because of any crime or misdemeanor in the expression of thought. A jury shall have exclusive jurisdiction over crimes and misdemeanors to which this article refers and a law of a constitutional nature shall determine all matters relating to this right. Art. 66. The profession of any religion is guaranteed. Every person has the right to practice his religion or belief in public or in private, through instruction, worship, and observance, limited only by peace, good morals, public order and the respect due to the country's symbols. Religious associations and groups are prohibited from participating in partisan politics and ministers of faiths from campaigning. Art. 67. The Catholic Church and all other faiths are recognized as juridical persons and they may acquire, possess, and dispose of property, provided such property is intended for religious purposes, social welfare or education. Such property is entitled to exemption from taxes, assessments and excises. The legal capacity of churches shall be determined by the rules of their own organization or constitutive bases. The state shall issue to the Catholic Church deeds of ownership in real property which it now peacefully possesses for its own purposes. Property recorded in the name of third persons or of the state for its services may not be affected. Art. 68. The right to bear arms is to be regulated by law. It is not a

crime or misdemeanor to have arms for personal use in the home if they do not come under legal prohibitions. Art. 69. Ownership of private property is guaranteed. The state has the obligation to ensure to a property owner the conditions necessary for the development and utilization of his property. The law shall specify the rights and obligations of a property owner. Property rights may not be restricted in any way by reason of a political offense. Confiscation of property, and confiscatory and excessive fines are prohibited. Fines may not exceed the value of an unpaid tax. Art. 70. Any person may freely dispose of his property according to law. Entailments (vinculaciones) are absolutely prohibited. In the economic regime of matrimony or of a de facto union, each spouse or cohabitant may freely dispose of property that is recorded in his or her name in public registers, save for any limitations expressly entered in each record. In all cases the spouses or cohabitants are liable to each other for the disposition that is made of common property. Art. 71. In special cases private property may be expropriated for reasons of the collective good, benefit, or public interest, duly proved. The expropriation must be carried out in accordance with proceedings prescribed by law and the property affected shall be appraised by experts on the basis of its actual value. In appraising the value of a property all elements, circumstances and conditions that determine its real price are to be taken into account, without depending exclusively on official statements or registers or preexisting documents. The compensation must be paid in advance in currency of legal tender, unless some other form is agreed upon. Only in the event of war, public disaster, or serious disturbance of the peace may property be occupied or seized, or expropriated without prior compensation, but this must be made effective immediately after the emergency has ended. The property of states at war with Guatemala or of their nationals may be expropriated, occupied, or seized without the formalities required under the foregoing paragraph. This subject shall be regulated by a law. No compensation of any kind may be demanded for the establishment of servitudes for public utility, except as compensation for damages actually caused to property. In the case of expropriation of land for the construction of roads or highways, the compensation need not be paid in advance. The law shall prescribe the procedure and form of payment. For the carrying out of national electrification projects any area of the affected property that is indispensable may be occupied, but the amount of the assessed valuation must be previously deposited in a banking institution by the authority in charge of the matter, in conformity with the law.

Art. 72. An inventor enjoys exclusive ownership of his work or invention for a period not to exceed fifteen years and providing that he first meets the requirements established by law. Authors enjoy the ownership of their works in accordance with the law and international treaties. Art. 73. Freedom of industry, commerce, and labor is recognized save for the limitations imposed by laws for social reasons or the national interest, which prescribe whatever may be necessary for a greater stimulus and increase of production. Art. 74. Every person has free access to the courts for the purpose of exercising his rights of action in accordance with the law. Foreigners may have recourse to diplomatic channels only in the event of a denial of justice. The mere fact that a decision may be adverse to their interests is not to be considered as such. In any case the legal recourses established by Guatemalan laws must have been exhausted. Art. 75. All acts of the administration are public and interested parties have the right at any time to obtain information and copies requested and exhibition of documents they wish to consult, with the exception of diplomatic or military matters or data furnished by private individuals under a guarantee of secrecy. Art. 76. Answer to a summons issued by any authority, officials, or public employee shall not be obligatory unless its purpose is specifically stated. Art. 77. The rights and guarantees granted by the Constitution do not exclude others which, although not expressly indicated therein, are inherent in the human person. Laws and governmental orders or those of any other kind that regulate the exercise of rights guaranteed by the Constitution shall be null and void ipso jure if they diminish, restrict, or distort such rights. Art. 78. Action for the prosecution of violations of rights and guarantees set forth in this title is public and may be brought by a simple denunciation without bond and without formality of any kind. Adequate resistance for the protection of the rights and guarantees set forth in the Constitution is legitimate.

CHAPTER II. HABEAS CORPUS AND AMPARO

Art. 79. Any person who finds himself illegally imprisoned, detained, or restrained in any other way in the enjoyment of his individual liberty, who is threatened by the loss of it, or suffers grievances even when his imprisonment or detention is based on law, has the right to request an immediate hearing before the courts of justice, whether for the purpose of

obtaining the restitution of his liberty, for bringing the grievances to an end, or for terminating the constraint to which he is subject. If the court orders the release of the illegally confined person, he is free at that moment and at that place. When it is so requested or when the judge or court deems it appropriate, the hearing shall be held at the place where the detained person is situated without prior advice or notification to the parties. The personal appearance of a detained person in whose favor a writ of habeas corpus has been claimed is imperative. Authorities who order the concealment of the detained person or who refuse to present him to the proper court, or who in any other way frustrate this guarantee, as well as agents who carry out such an order, shall be considered to have committed the crime of abduction and will be subject to punishment in accordance with the law. Art. 80. Every person has the right to petition for amparo in the following cases: 1. In order that his enjoyment of the rights and guarantees established by the Constitution may be maintained or restored. 2. In specific cases, to obtain a ruling that a law, a regulation or a decision or act of an authority is not binding on the petitioner because it contravenes or restricts any of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. 3. In specific cases, to obtain a ruling that an order or resolution which is not purely a legislative act of the Congress of the Republic does not apply to the petitioner because it violates a constitutional right. 4. In all other cases expressly set forth in the Constitution. In administrative matters the amparo action shall be in order whenever an authority, illegally or by abuse of power, issues a regulation, order, decision, or measure which causes a grievance or reasonable fear thereof, or which demands of the petitioner unreasonable requirements, provided there is no administrative recourse with suspensive effect against the challenged regulation or action, or the grievance cannot be remedied by any legal means of defense. Art. 81. The amparo action may not be initiated: 1. In matters of judicial concern, in respect of the parties and persons intervening therein. However, when sentence has not been passed, amparo may be resorted to against an infraction in procedure by the Supreme Court of Justice, in matters submitted to it for hearing. 2. Against decisions rendered on an appeal for amparo. 3. Against acts consented to by the aggrieved party. 4. Against health measures and orders issued for the purpose of preventing or averting public disasters. Art. 82. A declaration granting amparo shall have the following effects: 1. To suspend, in respect to the petitioner, the challenged law, regu-

lation, decision or act of an authority, and when pertinent, reestablishment of the affected legal situation or ending of the measure that was ordered. 2. In the case referred to in paragraph three of Article 62, if the authority does not rule within the period fixed by the Court of Amparo: (a) The interested party may appeal to the immediately superior authority or when pertinent to the Contentious-Administrative Court, for a decision to be rendered; and (b) If there is no superior authority or if from the nature of the matter it cannot be appealed through contentious-administrative channels, the official responsible shall be removed from office ipso facto on the day following expiration of the period fixed by the Court of Amparo, except in the case of an elected official, in which case he shall be liable for damages of any kind. 3. If the challenged act has been performed in such a way that it cannot be remedied or if its effects have ceased, the decision of the Court of Amparo shall so state and shall order that the pertinent civil and criminal liabilities be determined. Art. 83. In matters involving amparo, judicial interpretation shall always be broad in scope. Courts may not fail to entertain an appeal nor to rule on the grounds for it without incurring responsibility therefor, except in the cases referred to in the first paragraph of section 1 of Article 81. Judges who sit in amparo proceedings have the option of dispensing with evidence in cases in which in their opinion it is unnecessary. Whenever it is not clearly established what court shall have jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of Justice shall determine this without incidental proceedings. Art. 84. Habeas corpus and amparo shall be initiated through specific appeals. A constitutional law shall regulate the form and requirements thereof and shall determine what courts shall have jurisdiction, as well as all other aspects relating thereto, in accordance with the principles established by the Constitution. The recourse of personal appearance may be sought by the interested party or by any other person, without being subject to requisites of any kind. Any act which impedes, restricts, or in any way obstructs the exercise of these recourses or the application of the legal provisions which guarantee them is punishable. The decision rendered thereon may not give rise to a defense of res judicata.

Anyone who because of a provision of law, by custom, or by agreement with an employer works less than forty-eight hours a week shall have the right to receive full weekly wages. Effective work is defined as the entire time during which a worker remains under the orders or at the disposal of his employer. 6.

The right of workers and employers freely to organize for the exclusive purposes of economic protection and social betterment. These organizations and their directors, as such, may not take part in partisan politics.

Exception is made in cases of technical governmental assistance and of provisions in international treaties or inter-union agreements authorized by the executive organ. 13.

However, for the protection of a worker's family and by judicial order, a part of the wages may be withheld and delivered to the person entitled to them. 14. The right to strike and lock out, exercised in accordance with the law and as a last resort when all other attempts at conciliation have failed.

Obligation of the employer to give, in the first two weeks of December of each year, a bonus (aguinaldo) which shall not be less than fifty percent of the monthly salary, or an amount already established if larger, to those workers who have worked an uninterrupted year prior to the date of giving the bonus. The law shall regulate the cases of financial inability to give it. The bonus shall be given on a proportional basis to workers who served less than a year. This provision shall be applied for farm workers in accordance with a law to be enacted that will consider exceptional cases. 19. Obligation of the employer to grant to the spouse or cohabitant, and the minor or disabled children of a worker who dies while in his employ, compensation equivalent to one month's wages or salary for each year of work. This compensation is to be paid in monthly installments and the amount shall not be less than the last wage or salary received by the worker. A widow shall have this right as long as she does not remarry. If the death resulted from a cause that is fully covered by social security, this obligation of the employer is ended. In case the system does not cover the compensation in full the employer must pay the difference. Art. 115. The state shall see that housing for workers is adequate and meets necessary health conditions. It shall foster the construction of homes and the establishment of group settlements for workers. Art. 116. The rights affirmed in this chapter constitute minimum

guarantees that cannot be renounced by workers, and they may be increased by individual or collective contracts in the manner prescribed by law. Consequently, provisions that imply a reduction or denial of rights granted to a worker in the Constitution, in a law, in regulations, or in other provisions relating to labor, shall be ipso jure null and void and not binding on workers even when set forth in a labor agreement or other document.

This law shall not cover agencies, offices, or branches of the government which by the nature of their functions should be subject to special regulations. Art. 121. The rights and guarantees set forth in this chapter are declared to be a minimum. Those acquired previously by workers in the government and its decentralized, autonomous and semi-autonomous institutions may not be diminished or denied in any way. Laws or administrative regulations which counteract these standards shall be ipso jure null and void.

Public officials and employees are in the service of the state and not of any political party. The public function cannot be delegated except in those cases specified by law, and it may not be exercised without first taking an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. Art. 146. No civilian or military official or employee is obligated to carry out orders that are manifestly illegal or that imply the commission of a crime. Art. 147. The authorities are obligated to take action to protect persons and their rights without delay and any omission in the fulfillment of this duty renders anyone who has been derelict responsible therefor. Art. 148. If a public official or employee violates the law to the prejudice of individuals, in the performance of his duties, the state or the state institution in which he serves shall be subsidiarily liable for damages that may have been incurred. Neither Guatemalans nor foreigners may claim compensation from the state for damages caused by armed movements or civilian disturbances. Art. 149. The civil liability of public officials or employees for any transgression committed in the performance of their duties may be claimed as long as this has not been terminated by prescription, the period for which shall be twenty years. Criminal liability, in such cases, may be claimed during the course of double the period of time indicated for prescription by criminal law. In both cases the prescription period shall begin to run from the time the public official or employee has ceased to hold the position in which he incurred the liability. There is no prescription for crimes perpetrated by

public officials or employees, when by wrongful action or omission and for political motives, they caused the death of one or more persons. Art. 150. In cases of emergency or serious disturbance of the peace, and also during the periods that the conditions referred to in Article 153 are in effect, the public services may be militarized. Art. 151. It is a duty of the authorities to maintain the inhabitants of the Republic in the full enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. However, in cases of invasion of the territory, serious disturbance of the peace, public disaster, or of activities against the security of the state, the President of the Republic by a decree issued in Council of Ministers, may restrict the guarantees contained in Articles 45, 46, 51, 57, 58, 59, 63, 64, first paragraph of 65, 68, 75, 76, and the second paragraph of 78, to the extent strictly necessary in each case, and the Law on Public Order shall be immediately applicable. The decree shall specify : 1. The reasons that justify it. 2. The guarantee or guarantees that are restricted. 3. The territory affected. 4. The time it shall be in force. The same decree shall convoke Congress to meet within three days to ratify, modify or disapprove of the decree. If Congress is in session it must take such action immediately. The state of prevention does not need the approval of Congress and it shall not be in force for more than fifteen days. Art. 152. The decree may not be in force for more than thirty days. If before the expiration of this period the motives for its issuance have disappeared, it shall be immediately repealed, and for this purpose any citizen has the right to initiate such action. If on the contrary, the motives persist, a new decree in the same purport may be issued and the same formalities are to be observed. Whenever the Republic finds itself in a state of war, the decree is not subject to the time limitations indicated in the first paragraph. Art. 153. The Law on Public Order shall establish the measures to be taken, in accordance with the following gradation: 1. State of prevention. 2. State of alarm. 3. State of public disaster. 4. State of siege. 5. State of war. The Law on Public Order shall not affect the functioning of the agencies and institutions of the state, the members of which shall continue to enjoy the privileges and immunities recognized by law. Art. 154. Any person has the right to take legal action regarding liabilities deriving from unnecessary acts and measures intended to re-

strict guarantees if they are not authorized by the Law on Public Order. This right may be exercised whenever the respective decree has ceased to be in effect. Art. 155. Within a period of one month after a decree restricting guarantees has ceased to be in effect, the President of the Republic shall submit to Congress a detailed report of the acts that occurred and of the measures taken during the emergency.

TITLE V LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
CHAPTER I. CONGRESS

Art. 156. The legislative power is vested in the Congress of the Republic.

Art. 157. The Congress is composed of Deputies elected directly by the people, by universal suffrage. The Republic shall be divided into electoral districts. Each district shall elect two Deputies, but when the population of a district is in excess of 200,000 inhabitants an additional Deputy shall be elected for each additional 100,000 inhabitants or fraction of over 50,000. Each district shall also elect one alternate Deputy. Art. 158. Congress shall meet without the need of convocation on the fifteenth of June each year. Its regular sessions shall last four months and may be extended for such time as may be necessary. It shall meet in special session whenever convoked by the Standing Committee or by the executive, to deal with matters which gave rise to the convocation. It may discuss other matters if so determined by a favorable vote of two thirds of the total number of deputies. Fifteen or more Deputies have the right to petition the Standing Committee to convoke the Congress for appropriate reasons of public convenience or necessity. If the petition is made by at least one half plus one of the total membership, the Committee must immediately issue the convocation. Art. 159. All resolutions of Congress must be adopted with the concurrence of an absolute majority of its membership, except in cases for which the law shall require a specific number. Art. 160. Deputies are representatives of the nation and, as a guarantee of the exercise of their parliamentary function, from the day on which they are declared elected, they shall enjoy the following privileges: 1. Personal immunity from judicial accusation or trial unless Congress has previously declared that there are grounds for legal action. If dis-

covered in the act of committing a crime, they may be arrested, but must be immediatly placed at the disposal of Congress for the purposes of a previous hearing. 2. Freedom from liability for their opinions, for their initiative, and for the manner in which they handle affairs in the discharge of their duties. All state agencies are required to maintain toward the Deputies the consideration due them by reason of their high office. These privileges do not authorize arbitrary action, excess of personal initiative or any kind of maneuvers intended to counteract the principle of non-reelection for the presidency of the Republic. Congress alones hall have jurisdiction to try and decide whether there has been arbitrary action or excess of power and to impose pertinent disciplinary sanctions. If the declaration referred to in section 1 of this article has been made, the accused thereby becomes subject to the jurisdiction of a competent judge. If provisional detention is ordered, the accused is suspended from office until the writ of detention is altered. In the event of a final sentence of conviction the post thereupon becomes vacant. Art. 161. When Congress is not in session, the Standing Committee shall decide on whether or not there are grounds for action against a Deputy. Art. 162. Whenever for any reason the office of a Deputy becomes vacant, the alternate Deputy for the district in question must be called to fill it within eight days, and in his default, another person is to be selected by lot from among the remaining alternates. Alternate Deputies shall be entitled to remuneration only while holding office. Art. 163. To be elected Deputy a person must be a native Guatemalan as defined in Article 5 of this Constitution, enjoy his rights of citizenship, and be over thirty years of age. Art. 164. The following may not be Deputies: 1. Officials of the executive and judicial branches, and employees thereof or of the legislative branch. Persons holding a teaching position, and professionals in the service of social welfare establishments, are excepted from the foregoing prohibition. 2. Contractors for public works or enterprises which are being financed by funds of the state or a municipality, their guarantors, or anyone having claims pending for such works. 3. Relatives of the President and of the Vice-President of the Republic, within the fourth degree of consanguinity or second degree of affinity. 4. Those who have been convicted by final sentence in a case involving accounts, if their liabilities have not been settled. 5. Military men in active service. 6. Anyone representing the interests of companies or of individual persons operating public services.

7. Ministers of any religion or sect. If at the time of his election, or subsequently, the elected Deputy comes under any of the prohibitions included in this article, his office shall be declared vacant; but if he comes under section 1 he may choose between his employment or the office of Deputy. The election of a Deputy is void if he was an official exercising jurisdiction in the electoral district for which he was a candidate, or if he had exercised jurisdiction within three months prior to the date on which the election was held. The office of Deputy is compatible with the performance of a temporary or special diplomatic mission and with representation of Guatemala in international congresses. Art. 165. Deputies shall hold office for a term of four years. They may not be elected again until after the lapse of one term. Reelection is permitted only once. Congress shall elect its board of officers each year.

Art. 171. The Deputies in Congress, the executive organ acting through the Ministry concerned with the subject matter, the Council of State, and, in matters within their cognizance, the Supreme Court of Justice and the University of San Carlos of Guatemala may initiate laws. Art. 172. No law may be contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. Laws that violate or distort constitutional mandates are ipso jure null and void. Art. 173. After a bill has been introduced and accepted, it shall be brought up for debate at three different meetings, held on different days, and it may not be put to a vote until it is held to have had sufficient discussion in the third meeting. An exception is made of those cases that Congress, by a two-thirds vote of all Deputies in Congress, declares to be national emergencies. In all other situations and proceedings the provisions of the internal regulations shall be followed. Laws classified as constitutional require, for their amendment, a vote of two thirds of the Deputies in Congress, following favorable recommendation by the Council of State. Art. 174. If a bill that is introduced is not accepted by Congress, ten Deputies or the organ or entity that took the initiative in drafting it, may request the President of Congress to refer it to the Council of State for an opinion. The President of Congress must so act without other formality.

If after a bill has been accepted by Congress and the appropriate opinions have been obtained, two months have elapsed without it being discussed or approved or rejected, the same procedure as indicated in the preceding paragraph may be followed. In both cases, the Council of State shall have a period of two months in which to issue an opinion on the bill submitted to it. If the Council issues no opinion by the end of that period, its opinion shall be deemed unfavorable and the bill thereby rejected. If a favorable opinion is issued by the Council of State, on the bill as originally submitted or with amendments introduced, the bill shall be returned to Congress for study by a committee presided over by the President of Congress and composed of three deputies and three members of the Council of State, appointed by the directing officers of each body. If the opinion of the mixed committee is favorable, the bill and any pertinent observations shall be submitted to Congress for discussion and vote. If unfavorable, or if the committee issues no opinion within thirty days, the bill shall be held to be rejected. Art. 175. After a bill is accepted, five Deputies may make a motion that before it is submitted for discussion the opinion of the Council of State should be heard. If Congress approves the motion, the bill is to be submitted to the Council of State. The Council of State shall examine it and return it within a period of not over two months from the date of receipt, with the understanding that if the bill is not returned within that time, it shall be deemed that the Council had no observations to make. Art. 176. After a bill is approved it shall be sent to the executive for sanction and promulgation. Within a period of fifteen days and by agreement with the Council of Ministers, the President of the Republic may return the bill to Congress with such observations as he deems opportune. Congress shall consider the observations made by the executive, after hearing the opinion of the Council of State unless that body has already acted. If the observations are not accepted the bill may be tabled until the following term of sessions, but if Congress ratifies the bill by a twothirds vote of its members, the executive must sanction and promulgate the law within eight days after he receives it. If the executive does not do so, Congress shall order its publication as a law of the Republic. Art. 177. Whenever the executive has not returned a bill at the end of fifteen days from the date of receipt, it shall be held to be sanctioned and must be promulgated as law within the next eight days. In the event that Congress has adjourned before the end of the fifteen-day period in which it could have been returned, the executive must return the bill within the first eight days of the regular meetings of the following session. A law takes effect eight days after its publication in full in the Diario

Oficial (the official journal), unless the law itself extends or decreases that
period.

Art. 178. Executive approval is not required for regulations passed by Congress for its own internal functioning nor of provisions relating to Articles 166 and 169 of this Constitution.
CHAPTER IV. STANDING COMMITTEE

Art. 179. Each year before adjourning, Congress shall appoint eight Deputies to comprise the Standing Committee. The President of the legislative body shall also be a member and shall be chairman thereof, and the Committee shall function during the time that Congress is not in session. Three alternates shall be elected in the same manner. Art. 180. The Standing Committee shall meet whenever it is convoked by its chairman or when it is so decided by a majority of its members.

No court or authority may try a case that has already been terminated, except in those cases and forms of review specified by law. Art. 246. Courts of justice shall always observe the principle that the Constitution prevails over any law or international treaty. In specific cases, in any instance and in cassation, before sentence has been pronounced, the parties may claim unconstitutionality of all or a part of a law and the court must rule on the matter. If the law is declared to be unconstitutional, the sentence shall be limited to a statement that the legal provision does not apply to the case in question and this shall be transmitted to Congress.

The Contentious-Administrative Court has the duty of hearing cases involving disputes arising from acts or decisions of the public administration, of municipalities, and of the decentralized, autonomous or semi-autonomous agencies, in the course of performing regular duties, and also cases involving actions deriving from contracts and concessions of an

administrative nature. The recourse of cassation may be taken against final sentences and rulings on such cases. Art. 256. The judicial function in respect to accounts shall be exercised by the judges of first instance and the Court of Second Instance of Accounts.

This recourse is inadmissible in procedures taken to enforce financial obligations. Judges of first instance of accounts must have the same qualifications as are required of judges of first instance of ordinary jurisdiction. Art. 257.

CHAPTER V. COURT OF CONSTITUTIONALITY

Art. 262.

The President of the Supreme Court of Justice shall preside over the Court of Constitutionality. Art. 263. The Court of Constitutionality shall hear appeals entered against laws or governmental orders of a general nature on the ground that they contain the partial or total defect of being unconstitutional. A measure may be declared unconstitutional only by an affirmative vote of at least eight members of the Court. If the affirmative vote is less, the decision shall be limited to declaring the appeal denied. The Court must render its decision within a maximum period of two months from the date on which the appeal was entered. Art. 264. An appeal on grounds of unconstitutionality may be entered by: 1. The Council of State. 2. The Lawyers' Association, by decision of its general assembly. 3. The Public Ministry, by order of the President of the Republic in the Council of Ministers.

Any person or entity affected by the law or government order challenged as unconstitutional, with the assistance of ten practicing lawyers. The Court may order the suspension of the law or government order if it is obviously unconstitutional and susceptible of causing damage that cannot be remedied. The suspension shall be general in effect and shall be published in the Diario Oficial on the day following issuance of the order. For an order of suspension a vote of an absolute majority of all members of the Court of Constitutionality is sufficient. An appropriate constitutional law shall regulate all matters relating to this subject. Art. 265. If the decision declares that a law or government order of a general nature is wholly unconstitutional, the law or order is thereby no longer in effect; and if only partially unconstitutional, that part is thereby without effect. In both cases the effect ceases on the day following publication of the decision in the Diario Oficial.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, if suspension was ordered in conformity with Article 264 of this Constitution, the effects of the decision shall be retroactive to the date on which the suspension was published. No appeal of any kind may be entered against a decision of the Court of Constitutionality. TITLE VIII AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION
