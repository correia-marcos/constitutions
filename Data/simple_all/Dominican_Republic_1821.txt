CONSTITUTIVE ACT of the ProvisionalGovernment of the Independent State of the Spanish Part of Hayti.Santo Domingo, 1st December, 1821. (Translation.)
THE Citizens, Manuel Caravajal, Colonel of tie Liberating Army and Captain-General; Jos6 Nunez-de Caceres, Political Governor and President of the Independent State of the Spanish Part of Hayti; Juan Vicente Moscoso, Deputy for the Capital; Antonio Martinez Valdez, for the First Department of the North ; the Licentiate Juan Mepomuceno de Arredondo, for the Second Department of the North; Juan Ruiz, Colonel of the Liberating Army, for the Department of the East; and Vicente Mancebo, for that of the South ; having met in the Hall of the Municipal Council, for the purpose of establishing the form of Government, which, under existing circumstances, may appear best calculated to maintain public tranquillity and the good order of society; to provide for the general security and defence of the State, for the due administration of justice, and for the enjoyment and exercise of the most sacred rights of their Fellow Citizens, have agreed to decree, and they do accordingly decree, the following Provisional Regulation for the good order and administration of the State. ART. I. The Spanish Part of Hayti being, as it now is, a free and independent State, it is hereby declared that its form of Government is, and shall be, Republican; but until an exact system of National Representation be founded, on the most suitable basis, there shall be a Junta of Provisional Government, composed of the Captain-General, the Political Governor of the State, and the Deputies, or Substitutes, of the five Departments into which the Territory of the Spanish part of the Island is divided. The Secretary of this Junta is likewise that of the Captaincy General. II. From this Junta shall emanate all general Ordinances, all measures of public safety, all Regulations for the Departments of Administration in the State, and whatever else may appear most useful and conducive,-to the consolidation of our independence,-to the protecting it against all assaults of Enemies, whether external or internal,to the raising of Troops,-to the originating and imposing of contri-

butions,-to the abolition or modification of those already existing,to the defining the functions of the Judges, and of the Tribunals for the due administration of justice,-to the organizing of the Public Ofices,-to the fixing of the scale of custom duties, and the powers necessary for the collection of them,-to the encouragement of public education, agriculture, commerce, and the arts,-and, generally, to the execution of whatever may be required, for the prosperity, union, and security of the State, and also for the removal of the obstacles which may oppose or retard these important objects. 1l1. The Ordinances promulgated by this Junta shall possess, throughout the whole State, the force and vigour of Laws ; and the execution of them shall devolve upon the Political Governor and President of the State, who, in furtherance thereof, shall communicate them to all the Corporate Bodies, Chiefs, and Authorities, as well of the Capital as of the other Districts. IV. The Spanish part of this Island will immediately form an alliance with the Colombian Republic ; it will form one of the States of the Union; and, when the Treaty for that purpose shall have been adjusted and concluded, it will make common cause with the rest, and promote every thing which concerns the general interests of the Confederation. V. To attain this object, a Deputy will, as soon as possible, be dispatched to his Excellency the President of the Colombian Republic, to acquaint him with the political change which has taken place in Santo Domingo, and with its desire to accede to the Union of the States which already compose, or may hereafter compose, the Republic of Colombia. The Junta will select this Deputy, and provide him with the Instructions, Documents, and Powers, necessary for the discharge of his Mission: he will transmit accurate information respecting the general Constitution of that Republic, in order that this Spanish part of the Union may examine and approve it, previous to giving in its Act of Accession. VI. A similar Mission will be immediately sent to his Excellency the President of the neighbouring French portion of the Republic of Hayti, to propose a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Alliance with it, for the common defence and security of the two Territories, in the event of a hostile invasion, or of any internal plots against their liberty and independence. VII. As true civil liberty cannot possibly exist without a division of the powers of Government, the Junta declares that the Legislative Power shall centre in itself, until more tranquil circumstances shall favour the adoption and establishment of the proper basis on which a system of National Representation can be founded. The power of executing the Laws throughout the State belongs to the Political Governor and President, and that of administering justice, both in civil and criminal matters, to the Judges and Tribunals recognized

ST. DOMINGO.

by the same Laws; due regard being had to the proceedings and formalities prescribed by the latter. VIII. The rights of Man in society consist in his liberty, equality, security, and property. Liberty is the power to do whatever is not prohibited by the Laws, nor injurious to the rights of a third party. Equality recognizes no distinction of birth, or hereditary power : the Law is the same for all, and it may equally reward or punish every one. Security results from the confidence which every Member of the Community should feel, that the efforts of the social body have no other end than to secure him in the enjoyment of his rights. Property is the right, possessed by every one, of enjoying and disposing of his income, his substance, and the proceeds of his labour or industry. All property is inviolable : the State cannot touch it without some acknowledged necessity, or evident common utility ; nor even then, without indemnifying the Possessors according to the award of a certain number of upright Citizens. IX. The 'Citizens of the Independent State of the Spanish part of Hayti, are; 1st, Free Men, whatever be their colour or religion, who have been born in this Territory ; 2dly, Those born Abroad, provided they have resided in this Territory 3 years, or have married a Native Woman. In both cases, the Parties will state the requisite particuJars to the Government, by means of the depositions laid before the Municipal Alcaldes; and they will prove that they have lived obedient to the Laws of the Country, and have been occupied in some honest craft, business, or branch of industry ; they will then receive Letters of Citizenship, sealed with the Seal of the State, and under the authority of the Secretary of the Government. X. Letters of Naturalization will be granted by the Legislative Power-those of Citizenship having been previously obtained-in conformity with the established usages and formalities; but these Instruments will not confer the privilege of obtaining any Employment under Government, either in the Judicial, Financial, or Municipal Departments, nor in any other Civil or Political branch of the public service, with the exception of Military Employments, to which all may aspire, even to the highest grades. XI. Both Natives and Foreigners shall begin to exercise the rights of Citizenship at 18 years of age, so far as relates to voting at Elections; but no one shall himself be eligible to be elected under 25; and in certain cases the Law may require a more mature age for the filling of particular Posts. XII. The rights of Citizenship are lost ;-l. By judicial condemnation to any grievous or ignominious punishment; but the Tribunal by which these rights are abrogated can also restore them. 2. By holding employments or honours under any other Government. 3. By obtaining Lettera of Naturalization isl any Foreign Cotintry,

 559 1820-1821

ST. DOMINGO.

XIII. The exercise of the same rights is suspended;-l. By judicial interdiction on account of madness, insanity, or imbecility. 2. By insolvency, or non-payment of the public Taxes. 3. By a criminal conviction legally established. 4. By inability to read and write, so far as respects Candidates for Election, but not as respects the power of voting. 5. By possessing no employment, office, or other means of honest subsistence. XIV. The duties of a Citizen are: To maintain the independence and liberty of his Country, devoting his life and property to the furtherance of this sacred object; to contribute, in proportion to his ability, towards the expences of the State; to be faithful to the Constitution ; to obey the Laws, and to respect the Constituted Authorities. Whoever does not fulfil these duties is a bad Citizen, and is responsible to the Laws for his misconduct. XV. The house of every Citizen is a secure asylum for his person and he possesses within it: it cannot be forcibly entered, except whatever for in the cases prescribed by the Law, unless by the written authority of the Judge, or by the Judge in person when a crime is committed in it, or when a Delinquent, either caught in the fact, or prosecuted by competent Authority, takes refuge therein. Places of public resort, such as inns, coffee-houses, hotels, taverns, and all such as require a license from Government for their establishment, may be visited by day or night, according as good order, and the regulations of the Police may require. XVIz No Citizen can be prosecuted, arrested, or detained in prison, or in any other public place, except in such cases or with such formalities of procedure as the Laws prescribe. XVII. If the crime which gives rise to the arrest merits corporeal punishment, the Prisoner cannot be liberated on bail; but bail may be received when it merits only some pecuniary fine, or correctional punishment not exceeding one months' imprisonment. XVIII. The liberty of the Press shall subsist in its present state, subject to the formalities and punishments prescribed by the existing Laws, until others of a more suitable nature are promulgated. XIX. For the present, and until otherwise ordered, the existing Ayuntamientos, denominated Municipal, shall continue, both as to the form of their election, and to their renewal at the times and places already appointed; but their functions and powers shall be regulated by those which they did and do possess by the Laws of the Indies, and the local administration of the respective Towns. XX. In civil matters, the Alcaldes shall have no power of deciding summarily, except where the amount of the demand is less than 100 dollars, and then under the following conditions: If the amount do not exceed 25 dollars, the Alcalde may decide without the aid of Coadjutors; but when the amount is from 25 to 100, he shall be assisted by 2 upright

ST. DOMINGO.

.Men, chosen by the Parties, and the agreement of one or the other of the Coadjutors shall be necessary, before his decision can have the force of Law. In Criminal Cases, be the offence verbal or of a more tangible nature, provided it be not liable to any corporeal punishment, but to one purely correctional, (not exceeding for example an imprisonment of 20 days,) the aid of 2 Cvadju'tors shall be equally necessary. In both cases the Judgment shall be written in a book kept for the purpose, by the Clerk of the Court, and signed both by the Alcalde and the 2 Coadjutors; and if a Certificate of it be demanded by either of the Parties, it shall be given by the Clerk. This book shall be transmitted from one Alcalde to another, and remain in their custody. XXI. The Alcaldes may also receive information from witnesses, relating to the cases mentioned in Article IX of this Regulation and to any other in which individual interests are concerned; such as those concerning the legitimacy of births, shipwrecks, deaths, or absence, provided always that the Law does not require any special medium of justification. XXII. In all Cities, Towns, and Villages of the State, Justice shall be administered in the First Instance, in such Civil and Criminal Cases as are not mentioned in Article XX of this provisional Regulation, by an Alcalde Mayor, a Law Judge, who shall be appointed by the Government, and one of whom shall reside in the principal place of each of the 5 Departments. XXIII. The-salary of these Judges, shall, for the present, be 1,500 dollars, paid by the State; they shall also receive the fees arising from Certificates and other duties, according to the existing rates: they shall not issue processes: either in Civil or Criminal Cases, to any other than the Municipal Alcaldes of the Villages, or the Alcaldes Mayores of the Departments, when they may offer their advice, with the requisite instructions : that advice and those instructions, shall in no case be neglected ;-all sball mutually assist each other to ensure the due administration of Justice. XXIV. These Judges shall be replaced, pro tempore, in cases of vacancy, death, absence, or legal impediment, by the municipal Alcaldes of the Villages in which the vacancy occurs, until (the fact having been communicated to the Government) a Successor be appointed; and they may be cited before the Alcaldes themselves, in such Civil and Criminal Suits as occur among them, in which case the municipal Alcalde shall consult with the legal Assessor. XXV. A Tribunal of Appeal shall be established in this Capital, to which Parties can refer, in Civil Cases, and the Judges submit the grounds of their decisions in Criminal ones: this Tribunal shall, in future, be denominated The Superior Court of Justice; and the number of Judges of which it shall be composed, their attributes, salaries, 20

ST. DOMINGO.

and order of procedure, shall be determined, as soon as possible, by a special Regulation. XXVI. In the decisions upon Civil Suits, and the infliction of punishment in Criminal Cases, the Judges of the First Instance, and those of the Superior Court of Justice, shall govern themselves by the provisions of the Laws existing at the time of the publication of the Political Constitution of the Spanish Nation, until others be formed more analogous to the disposition, education, and habits, of the Citizens of the State. XXVII. The Office of Intendant shall henceforth be separate from that of' Governor. ro the former belongs the entire economy, policy, and control of the De-partment of Finance, and the collection, management, and distribution of the Revenue; but Civil and Criminal matters, relating to smuggling, the payment of contributions, and public demands, to incorpo rated or reversionary rights, the Customs, the Post Offices, the offe ices of public Servants, committed in the exercise of their functions, an I to other Causes and Suits of which the Intendants have hitherto had cognizance, shall, in the first instance, be determined in the Court of the Alcalde Mayor; and all Appeals shall be carried to the Superior Court of Justice, for its revision and decision. XXVIII. There shall be no alteration at present in the imposts, duties, taxes, or established contributions; and their collection and recovery, under whatever title or denomination, shall be continued as heretofore; the produce, however, of those which were destined for the expenses of the Provincial Administrations, shall be paid into the general Treasury of the State. XXIX. Such Debts as may be contracted henceforth, for maintaining the liberty and Independence of the Country, or for meeting the other unavoidable expenses of the public Administration, shall be recognized as legitimate by the Government, and all the revenues The of the State shall be applicable to the payment of them. measures to be taken with respect to the old Debt contracted by the late Spanish Government, shall be decided upon by the general Congress of the Union; but the Pensions assigned to the Widows, Fathers, and Children, of those who fell in the War of the re-conquest, shall continue to be paid, as also such as have been granted to those who have been disabled in the same Cause. XXX. With respect to the remaining branches of the public Administration, the Junta will apply itself to the organization of such a system of Revenue as may appear best adapted to the state of the Country, and its territorial resources; one of its principal dutiesbeing, to reduce the expenses to the smallest possible amount, and to circumscribe the number of Persons to be employed, so that no more be retained than are necessary for the dispatch of business.

When the Junta deliberates upon the tarif of the customs, the imposition of any new duty, or the modification of the duties which appear exorbitant, or upon the reduction or augmentation of the number of Offic*s of the Revenue, and the amount of the salaries to be granted, the Intendant shall be present, to give his opinion, but shall not be able to vote. XXXII. The Political Constitution and Laws of the Spanish Monarchy, and the Corporations, and other Establishments connected therewith, are henceforth abolished, with the exception of %hat is retained in these Provisional Regulations, or of those which it may be necessary to form hereafter.

XXXIV. For the present, and until some new Regulation of the Military Bodies of the State shall be fbrmed, abolishing the odious distinction which has hitherto existed between the Soldier and the simple Citizen, and which has been, at all times, the origin of dissensions and parties in the State, those Bodies shall continue unaltered, each being governed by the General Ordinance or by its own particular Regulations: but the peculiar immunities assumied by the said privileged Bodits shall entirely cease; the Individuals composing them being, every where, subject to the jurisdiction of the Captain General. XXXV. All machiinations, plots, projects, plans of sedition and tumults, insurrections, disturbances, and riotous assemblages, calculated, or in any way tending, to overturn the new Republican System, to destroy the liberty and i ndepeudence of the Country, to impede the course of the measures adopted, to disturb public tranquillity, or to encourage adherence to Spain, shall be considered as Treason against the State, shall be subject to Martial Law, and tried by a Council of War; and the punishment awarded to the Delinquents shall be carried into effect within 24 hours after the passing of the Sentence. Criminals of this class shall not be allowed the plea of any privilege to exempt them from the authority of a Couucil of War. XXXVI.
