CONSTITUTION OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TITLE I Section I The Nation, its Sovereignty and its Government Article 1 The Dominican people constitute a Nation organized as a free and independent State, bearing the name of Dominican Republic. Article 2 The national sovereignty rests with the people, from whom emanate all the powers of the State, which are exercised by representation. Article 3 The sovereignty of the Dominican Nation as a free and independent State is inviolable. The Republic is and shall always be free and independent of any foreign power. Consequently, none of the public powers organized by the present Constitution may perform or permit the performance of acts which constitute a direct or indirect intervention in the internal or external affairs of the Dominican Republic or an interference which is against the personality and integrity of the State and of the functions recognized and consecrated in this Constitution. The principle of nonintervention constitutes an invariable norm of Dominican international policy. The Dominican Republic recognizes and applies the norms of general and American international law to the extent that its public powers have adopted them and declares itself in favor of the economic solidarity of the countries of America and will support any initiative proposed to protect its basic products and raw materials. Article 4 The government of the Nation is essentially civil, republican, democratic, and representative. It is divided into the Legislative Power, the Executive Power, and the Judicial Power. These three powers are independent in the exercise of their respective functions. They are entrusted with these powers and are responsible for them and may not delegate their powers, which are solely those specified by this Constitution and the laws. Section II The Territory

Article 5 The territory of the Dominican Republic is and shall be inalienable. It consists of the eastern part of the island of Santo Domingo and its adjacent islands. Its permanent and immutable land boundaries are fixed by the Boundary Treaty of 1929 and its Protocol of Revision of 1936. It is divided politically into one district known as the National District, which includes the Capital of the Republic, and into such provinces as are determined by law. The provinces in turn are divided into municipalities. The corresponding territorial sea and the submarine surface and subsoil, as well as the air space above them, are also parts of the national territory. The extent of the territorial sea, of the air space, and of the contiguous zone and its defense, as well as of the submarine surface and subsoil and the utilization thereof, shall be established and regulated by law. The law shall specify the number of provinces, determine the names and the boundaries of these and of the National District, as well as of the municipalities into which they are divided, and it may also create new political divisions of the territory, under other names. Article 6 The city of Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n is the capital of the Republic and the seat of the national government. Section III Frontier Economic and Social System Article 7 The economic and social development of the territory of the Republic along the frontier, as well as the dissemination there of culture and the religious tradition of the Dominican people, are of supreme and permanent national interest. The agricultural and industrial utilization of frontier rivers shall continue to be regulated by the principles affirmed in Article 6 of the 1936 Protocol revising the Boundary Treaty of 1929 and in Article 10 of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Arbitration of 1929. TITLE II Section I Individual and Social Rights Article 8 The effective protection of the rights of the human person and the maintenance of the means which permit him to improve himself progressively within a system (orden) of

individual liberty and social justice, compatible with public order, the general well-being and the rights of all, are recognized as the principal aim (finalidad principal) of the State. In order to guarantee the realization of these aims the following norms are set: 1. The inviolability of life. Therefore, neither the death penalty, torture, nor any other punishment or oppressive procedure or penalty that implies loss or diminution of the physical integrity or health of the individual may be established, pronounced or applied. 2. Individual security. Therefore: a. Imprisonment shall not be established for debts that do not arise from infractions of the penal laws. b. No one may be sent to prison or restrained in his freedom without an order written and defined by a competent judicial official, except in case of flagrante delicto. c. Any person deprived of his freedom without cause or without legal formalities, or in cases not covered by law, shall be placed at liberty immediately upon his own demand or that of any person. d. Any person deprived of his freedom shall be submitted to the competent judicial authority or freed within forty-eight hours after his arrest. e. Every arrest shall be void or shall become imprisonment within forty-eight hours after the arrested person has been submitted to the competent judicial authority, and the interested party must be notified within the same period of the ruling in the case. f. It is strictly prohibited to transfer any person being held in custody from a prison establishment to some other place without written order and reason therefor from a competent judicial authority. g. Every person holding an arrested person in his custody must present him as soon as requested to do so by competent authority. The law of habeas corpus shall determine the manner of proceeding summarily in complying with the provisions of sections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g), and shall establish the penalties to the imposed. h. No one may be tried twice for the same offense. i. No one may be required to testify against himself. j. No one may be sentenced without a hearing or due summons, or without observance of the procedures established by law to ensure impartial judgment and the exercise of the right of defense. Hearings shall be public, unless excepted by law in cases where publicity might be prejudicial to the public order or to good customs.

3. The inviolability of the home. No entry of a home may be made except in those cases specified by law and according to formalities prescribed therein. 4. Freedom of transit, except for restrictions resulting from penalties imposed by a court, or by police, immigration, and health laws. 5. No one shall be obligated to do what the law does not demand nor be prevented from doing what the law does not prohibit; the law is equal for all; it may not order more than what is just and useful for the community nor may it prohibit more than would be prejudicial to it. 6. Everyone may, without prior censorship, freely express his thought in writing or by any other means of expression, graphic or oral. Whenever the thought expressed threatens the dignity and morals of persons, the public order, or the good customs of society, penalties prescribed by law shall be imposed. All subversive propaganda is prohibited, whether anonymous or by any other means of expression, for the purpose of inciting disobedience of the law, but this shall not limit the right of analysis or criticism of legal principles. 7. Freedom of association and of assembly without arms, for political, economic, social, cultural, or any other purpose, provided that by its nature it is not contrary or threatening to the public order, national security or good customs. 8. Freedom of conscience and of worship, subject to respect for public order and good customs. 9. The inviolability of correspondence and all other private documents, which may not be seized or inspected, except through legal procedures as evidence in judicial proceedings. The secrecy of communication by telegraph, telephone, and cable is also inviolable. 10. All information media have free access to official and private news sources, provided they do not go against public order or jeopardize national security. 11. Freedom of work. The law may, as required by the general interest, establish the maximum working day, days of rest and vacations, minimum wages and salaries and their forms of payment, social security, the participation of nationals in all work, and in general all provisions for State protection and assistance for workers that may be considered necessary, whether the work is manual or intellectual. a. Union organization of labor is unrestricted, provided the trade unions, craft unions, or other similar associations adopt in their bylaws and in their conduct a democratic organization compatible with the principles affirmed in this Constitution and strictly for labor and peaceful ends.

b. The State shall use such means as are available to it to make it possible for workers to acquire the tools and instruments indispensable for their labor. c. The form and extent of the participation of permanent workers in the profits of every agricultural, industrial, commercial, or mining enterprise may be fixed by law in accordance with the nature of the enterprise, and respecting the legitimate interest of both the proprietor and the worker. d. The right of workers to strike and of employers to a lockout, in private enterprise, is acknowledged, provided it is exercised in accordance with the law and to settle strictly labor disputes. Any interruption, obstruction, or stoppage of activities or intentional reduction in the output of labor in private or State enterprise is prohibited. Any strike, lockout, interruption, obstruction, or intentional reduction of output affecting the administration, public services, or public utilities, is unlawful. The law shall enact the measures necessary to guarantee the enforcement of these rules. 12. Freedom of enterprise, commerce, and industry. Monopolies may be established only in favor of the State or State institutions. The creation and organization of these monopolies shall be done by law. 13. The right to own property. Consequently, no one may be deprived of it except for a justified reason of public benefit or social interest, after payment of its fair value determined by the judgment of a competent tribunal. In case of public disaster, compensation need not be paid in advance. The penalty of general confiscation of property may not be imposed for reasons of a political nature. a. The dedication of land to useful purposes and the gradual elimination of large holdings (latifundio) is declared to be of social interest. Lands belonging to the State or which the State acquires by degrees or by expropriation, in the manner prescribed by this Constitution, and which the State does not devote or will not devote to other purposes of general interest, are to be used in plans of agrarian reform. Encouragement and cooperation in an effective integration of the rural population into the national life, through an improvement in methods of farm production and the cultural and technical training of rural men, is likewise declared to be a main objective of the social policy of the State. b. The State may convert its enterprises into properties of cooperation or cooperative economy. 14. Exclusive ownership, for the time and in the manner determined by law, of inventions and discoveries, as well as of scientific, artistic, and literary productions. 15. With the aim of strengthening its stability and well-being, its moral, religious, and cultural life, the family shall receive the broadest possible protection from the State.

a. Maternity, regardless of the condition or status of the mother, shall have the protection of the public powers and shall be entitled to public assistance in case of desertion. The State shall adopt measures of hygiene and other steps designed to prevent infant mortality insofar as possible and to attain a healthy development of children. The establishment of the family homestead (bien de familia) is also declared to be of high social interest. The State shall encourage family savings and the establishment of credit, producer, distribution, and consumer cooperatives and any others that may be useful. b. The establishment of every Dominican home on land or with improvements belonging to the occupant is declared to be of high social interest. To this end, the State shall encourage the development of public credit on advantageous terms, intended to make it possible for all Dominicans to possess a comfortable and sanitary home. c. Marriage is recognized as the legal basis of the family. d. The married woman shall enjoy full civil capacity. The law shall enact the necessary measures to protect the property rights of a married woman, under any system. 16. Freedom of education. Elementary education shall be compulsory. It is a duty of the State to furnish a basic education to all inhabitants of the national territory and to take the necessary steps to eliminate illiteracy. Both elementary and secondary education, as well as that offered in agricultural, vocational, art, commercial, manual arts, and home economics schools, shall be free. The State shall strive for the widest possible dissemination of science and culture, thus adequately providing for all persons to benefit from the results of scientific and moral progress. 17. The State shall encourage the progressive development of social security so that every person shall be able to enjoy adequate protection against unemployment, sickness, disability, and old age. The State shall offer its protection and assistance to old people, in a manner determined by law, in order that their health shall be preserved and their well-being ensured. The State shall also offer social assistance to the poor. This assistance shall consist of food, clothing, and insofar as possible, adequate housing. The State shall strive for improvement in nourishment, sanitary services, and hygienic conditions; it shall seek means of preventing and treating diseases, epidemic, endemic and others, as well as providing free medical and hospital attention to those who require it owing to their meager economic resources. The State shall combat the social vices by adequate measures and with the help of international conventions and organizations. Specialized centers and organs shall be established for the correction and eradication of these vices.

Section II Duties Article 9 Considering that the prerogatives recognized and guaranteed in the preceding article of this Constitution presume the existence of a correlative juridical and moral responsibility that is binding on the conduct of man in society, the following are declared to be fundamental duties: a.

Every able-bodied Dominican has the duty to perform the civilian and military services his country may require for its defense and preservation. c.
