CONSTITUTION OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

TITLE I
Section I The Nation and Its Government Article 1. The Dominican people form a nation organized into a free and independent state, with the name of the Dominican Republic. Article 2, Its government is essentially civil, republican, democratic, and representative. It is divided into the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. These three branches are independent in the exercise of their respective functions. Those entrusted with these branches are responsible for them and may not delegate their responsibilities, which are solely those specified by this Constitution and the laws. Article 3. The sovereignty of the Dominican nation as a free and \independent state is inviolable. Consequently, none of the public powers organized by the present Constitution may perform or permit or accept the performance of acts which constitute a direct or indirect intervention in the internal or external affairs of the Dominican Republic or an interference which is against the personality and integrity of the state and of -the functions recognized and affirmed in this Constitution. The principle of nonintervention affirmed in this article constitutes a rule for Dominican international policy. Article 4. The Dominican Republic shall not favor any international condemnation which, in the opinion of its Government, may result in prejudice to a brother people of the Americas.

Section II The Territory Article 5. The territory of the Dominican Republic is and shall be inalienable. It consists of the eastern part of the island of Santo Domingo and its adjacent islands. Its permanent and immutable land boundaries are fixed by the Boundary Treaty of 1929 and its Protocol of Revision of 1936. It is divided politically into one district known as the National District, which includes the capital of the Republic, and into such provinces as are determined by law. The

provinces in turn are divided into municipalities. The corresponding territorial sea and continental shelf are also parts of the national territory. The extent of the territorial sea and continental shelf shall be fixed by law. Paragraph. The law shall fix the number of provinces and their boundaries and those of the National District, as well as those of the municipalities into which they are divided, and it may also create, under other names, new political divisions of the territory. Article 6. The city of Santo Domingo is the capital of the Republic and the seat of the national government.

Section HI Frontier Economic and Social System Article 7. The economic and social development of the territory of the Republic along the frontier, as well as the dissemination there of culture and the religious tradition of the Dominican people, are declared to be of supreme and permanent national interest. The agricultural and industrial utilization of frontier rivers shall continue to be regulated by the principles affirmed in Article 6 of the 1936 Protocol revising the Boundary Treaty of 1929 and in Article 10 of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Arbitration of 1929.

TITLE II
Human Rights

Article 8. The effective protection of the rights of the human being and the creation and maintenance of the means which will permit him to improve himself progressively within a system of individual liberty and social justice, compatible with public order, the general well-being and the rights of all, are recognized as the principal aims of the state. In order to guarantee the accomplishment of these aims the following standards are set:
1) The inviolability of life. Neither the death penalty nor any other that implies loss of the physical integrity of the individual may be established. The law may, however, establish the death penalty for those who, in case of legitimate defense against a foreign State, become guilty of crimes against the success of national arms or of treason or espionage in favor of the enemy. 2) Individual security. Therefore: a) Corporal punishment shall not be established for debts that do not arise from infractions of the penal laws. b) No one may be sent to prison or restrained in his freedom without an order written and defined by a competent judicial official, except in case of flagrante delicto. c) Any person deprived of his freedom without cause or without legal formalities, or in cases not covered by law, shall be placed at

liberty immediately upon his own demand or that of any person. The law of habeas corpus shall determine the manner of proceeding summarily in these cases. d) Any person deprived of his freedom shall be submitted to the competent judicial authority or freed within forty-eight hours after his arrest. e) Every arrest shall be void or shall become imprisonment within forty-eight hours after the arrested person has been submitted to the competent judicial authority, and the interested party must be notified within the same period of the ruling handed down in the case. f) No one may be tried twice for the same offense. g) No one may be required to testify against himself. h) No one may receive sentence without a hearing or due summons, or without observance of the procedures established by law to ensure impartial judgment and the exercise of the right of defense. Hearings shall be public, unless excepted by law in cases where publicity might be prejudicial to the public order or to good customs. 3) Freedom of work. The law shall, as required by the general interest, establish the maximum working day, days of rest and vacations, minimum wages and salaries and their forms of payment, social security, the participation of nationals in all work, and in general all provisions for state protection and assistance for workers that may be considered necessary. 4) Freedom of enterprise. Monopolies may be established only in favor of the state or state institutions. The creation and organization of these monopolies shall be done by decree-law of the executive power. 5) Freedom of conscience and of worship, subject to respect for the public order and good customs. 6) Freedom of education. Elementary education shall be compulsory for children of school age and for all those who for diverse reasons have not previously been able to enjoy this right. It is hereby declared a duty of the state to furnish a basic education to all inhabitants of the national territory and to take the necessary steps to eliminate or prevent the reappearance of illiteracy. Both elementary education and the education offered in vocational, art, commercial, manual arts, and home economics schools shall be free. These duties of the state presume on the part of persons inhabiting the territory of the Republic the correlative obligation of attending the educational institutions of the country in order to acquire at least an elementary education. The state shall strive for the widest possible dissemination of science and culture, thus adequately facilitating all persons to benefit from the results of scientific progress. 7) The right to expression of thought without prior censorship. The law shall prescribe penalties applicable to those who threaten the honor of persons, the social order, or the public peace.

8) Freedom of association and of assembly for peaceful purposes. 9) The right to own property. This, however, may be taken over for a duly justified reason of public benefit or social interest, and after fair compensation. In cases of public disaster compensation need not be paid in advance. A general confiscation of property is prohibited, except as punishment of persons guilty of treason or espionage in behalf of an enemy during a time of legitimate defense against a foreign state or guilty of abuse or usurpation of power or of any public functions for purposes of enriching themselves or others. In these last cases the property acquired by the state through confiscation ordered by law will have first priority as means of repairing the moral and material damage caused by the usurpation or abuse of power or public function. The law may establish special procedures for acquisition by the state of areas' or portions of rural lands that may be needed for introducing and developing adequate systems or agrarian reforms, in which case the same law shall regulate the form of ind nity or compensation. 10) The inviolability of correspondence and all other private documents, which may not be seized or inspected except through legal procedures as evidence in matters under adjudication. The secrecy of communication by telegraph, telephone, and cable is also inviolable. 11) The inviolability of the home. No entry of the home may be made except in those cases indicated by law and according to formalities prescribed therein. 12) Freedom of transit, except for restrictions resulting from penalties imposed by a court, or by police, immigration, and health laws. 13) Exclusive ownership, for the time and in the manner determined by law, of inventions and discoveries, as well as of scientific, artistic, and literary productions. 14) With the aim of strengthening its stability and well-being, its moral, religious, and cultural life, the family shall receive the broadest possible protection from the state. The law shall provide the necessary means for protecting maternity and, in particular, mothers, during a reasonable period before and after childbirth. One of the principal objectives of the social policy of the state is declared to be the constant reduction of infant mortality and a sound development of children. The establishment of the family "homestead" (bien de familia) is also declared to be of high social interest. The state shall encourage family savings and the establishment of credit, producer, distribution, and consumer cooperatives and any others that may be useful. 15) The state shall continue the progressive development of social security so that one day every person shall enjoy adequate protection against unemployment, sickness, disability, and old age. 16) The state shall offer its protection and assistance to old people in a manner determined by law, in order that their health shall be preserved and their well-being ensured.

17) The state shall offer social assistance to the poor. This attention shall consist of food, clothing, and insofar as possible, adequate housing. 18) The state shall strive for improvement in the meals, housing, sanitary services, and hygienic conditions in work establishments; it shall seek the means for the prevention and treatment of epidemic and endemic diseases and any others, as well as the provision of free medical and hospital attention to those who require it because of their meager economic resources.

19) Husband and wife may freely arrive at their marriage agreements or elect any system adopted by law, which shall always establish the system of separation of property and prescribe what shall govern in the absence of special provisions, the following characteristics being understood to be inherent in this system of separation of property: (a) that each spouse shall retain the ownership, administration, enjoyment, and free disposition of his or her property; (b) that any renunciation by the wife of the right to recover the administration of her property which she had entrusted to her husband is void; and (c) if after ten years of a marriage under separation of property, one of the spouses dies, his or her creditors, heirs, legatees, or successors may not, for any reason, initiate any action against the surviving spouse for the restitution or return of property. 20) Every person has the right to exclude from his estate, following a declaration of unworthiness, descendants who have performed obviously prejudicial acts affecting his reputation and dignity, or who have performed acts contrary to public or private morals which might besmirch the good name of his family. Paragraph I. The law may add other causes of unworthiness and must provide that in all cases the judgment rendered by a court of first instance cannot be appealed, and that the parent may, by a later public instrument or by provision in a will, annul the judgment that was rendered. Paragraph II. The law shall regulate the procedure to be followed for obtaining the declaration of exclusion from an estate by reason of unworthiness. Article 9. No one shall be obligated to do what the law does not demand, nor be prevented from doing what the law does not prohibit. Article 10. The enumeration contained in Article 8 is not restrictive and hence does not exclude the existence of other rights of the same nature.

TITLE III
