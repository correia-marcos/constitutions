DANISH CONSTITUTIONAL LAWfor the Special Affairs of Iceland.-Amalienborg, January 5, 1874. (Translation.) WE, Christian the Ninth, by the Grace of God King of Denmark, of the Vandals and Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, Ditmarsken, Lauenburg, and Oldenburg, make known: After we had several times submitted to the Althing of Iceland proposals for the settlement of the constitutional relations of Iceland, without having succeeded in obtaining its approval, the Althing of last year expressed the wish, partly in a most humble petition to us, partly in a most humble address referring to itpraying that we might grant to Iceland a Constitutional Law for its particular affairs, and especially to the effect that this Constitution might come into force in the present year, so memorable for Iceland. Being moved to further the request thus made by our dear and faithful Althing, we have resolved, on the basis of the former projects of a Constitutional Law which have been proposed to the Althing, and taking into especial consideration the points indicated by the Thing in the before-named address, to grant the following Constitutional Law for the special affairs of Iceland. I. 1. With regard to all affairs which, according to 3 of the Law of the 2nd of January, 1871, defining the constitutional position of Iceland in the Kingdom, appertain specially to Iceland, the country has its own (distinct) legislation and administration, so that the legislative power is vested in the King and the Althing in concert, the executive power in the King, and the judicial power in the tribunals. In consequence of 2 of the above-named Law, Iceland on the one hand takes no share in the legislative power with respect to the general affairs of the Kingdom, so long as it is not represented in the Rigsdag, whilst, on the other hand, Iceland is not called upon to contribute to the general requirements of the Kingdom. 2. The King has, within the limits fixed by this Constitutional

Law, supreme authority over all the special affairs of Iceland, and exercises it through the Minister for Iceland. The supreme local authority in Iceland is, under the responsibility of the Minister, entrusted to a Governor (Landsb6vding) who is named by the King, and is to live in the country itself. The extent of the powers conferred on the Landsh6vding is fixed by the King. 3. The Minister is responsible for the maintenance of the Constitution. The Minister is to be held responsible by the Althing, in all matters concerning it, subject to certain rules to be defined by law. If the Althing finds reason to complain of the manner in which the Landsh6vding exercises the power confided to him, the King decides on its representations, which are to be framed by the Thing in each particular case, whether and in what manner he is to be made responsible. 4. The King appoints all functionaries to the same extent as heretofore. Alterations with respect to this rule can only be made by law. No one can be appointed in Iceland unless he is in possession of the public rights enjoyed by the natives, and has proved that he has complied with the existing conditions as regards the knowledge of the language of the country. Every functionary takes the oath on the Constitution. The King can dismiss the functionaries appointed by him. Their pension is fixed according to the law on pensions. The King can remove functionaries, but only on the condition that their official emoluments shall not be reduced, and that they may be given the choice between removal and dismissal with a pension in conformity with the general regulations. Exceptional cases to which 44 is not applicable must be fixed by law. 5. Every second year the King convokes a general Althing. Without the King's consent the Thing cannot remain in session for more than 6 weeks. Alterations of this rule can only be made by law. 6. The King can call extraordinary sessions of the Althing, the duration of which depends on his pleasure. 7. The King can adjourn the meetings of the ordinary Althing for a fixed period, though not without the consent of the Thing for more than 4 weeks, and then only once a year. 8. The King can dissolve the Althing, in which case new elections are to take place in the course of two months after the dissolution, and the Althing is to be convoked for the year following the dissolution. 9. The King can cause projects and resolutions to be submitted to the Althing.

10. The consent of the King is requisite to give force to a resolution of the Althing. The King orders the publication and enforces the execution of the law. If the King has not confirmed a project of law, passed by the Althing, before the meeting of the next ordinary Althing, it is annulled. 11. In very urgent cases, when the Althing is not assembled, the King can issue provisional laws, which must not, however, be in opposition to the Constitution, and must invariably be submitted for approval to the next Althing. 12. The King pardons and reprieves. 13. The King grants, partly directly, partly through the authorities concerned, such concessions and legal exemptions as have been granted in accordance with the practice heretofore existing. 1I. 14. The Althingis composed of 30 members elected by the people and of 6 named by the King. The number of the members to be elected by the people can be altered by law. The members elected by the people, as well as those nominated by the King, hold, as a rule, their seats in the Althing for 6 years, and, as far as the Royal nominees are concerned, dissolutions do not affect their position in the Althing. If one of those elected or nominated dies or retires during the said period of 6 years, -the election or nomination is, however, only valid for the remainder of this term. 15. The Althing consists of two Chambers, the Upper and the Lower. The Upper is composed of 12, the Lower of 24 members. These numbers, however, can be altered by law. 16. All the Royal nominees sit in the Upper Chamber. All the other members of this Chamber are chosen for the entire period by the whole Althing, when first it meets after new elections have been held, and freely from among the members of the Althing, who have been returned by the people. If during this period some of the seats in the Upper Chamber held by members elected by the people become vacant, the two Chambers assemble after the election of a new member and select one of those returned by the people to fill the vacant seat during the rest of the term. 17. The electoral franchise is held by: a. All peasants who are engaged in agriculture and pay communal and other public taxes; but, nevertheless, those who in virtue of any special rule may be exempted from some public tax or other, do not therefore lose their electoral rights. b. Citizens of market towns who contribute at least 8 crowns (I rigsdalers) yearly to the Commune. c. Cottagers who contribute at least 12 crowns (6 rigsdalers) yearly to the Commune. d. Functionaries, whether appointed by the King or named by the authorities, on whom the King has conferred that power.

e. Those who, though not functionaries, have passed either an academic examination or the final test at the clerical seminary of Reykjavik, or other similar public examinations which are or may be established, provided they are not in domestic service. In order to possess the right of voting, at the elections, the electors must likewise have completed their 25th year, have an unblemished reputation, have resided in the electoral district for a year, hold property and not be supported by public charity, or have been supported by it, unless the relief granted has been repaid or given up. 18. Every one is qualified for election, who, according to the above paragraph, is entitled to the electoral franchise, in case: 1. He should not be subject to or in the service of any foreign State ; 2. He has resided at least 5 years in the European portion of the Danish dominions; 3. He, at the time when the election takes place, has completed his 30th year. Any one may, however, be elected who resides outside the electoral district, or has resided in it for less than a year. The special rules with regard to the elections are laid down by the electoral law. II. 19. The ordinary Althing assembles on the first week-day of July of every alternate year, should the King not have named another day in the same year. 20. The ordinary place of meeting of the Althing is Reykjavik. In extraordinary cases the King can decide that the Althing is to assemble at some other place in Iceland. 21. Each of the Chambers of the Althing is entitled to propose, and, as far as it is concerned, to frame laws; each of the Chambers can likewise present addresses to the King. 22. Each 'of the Chambers of the Althing can appoint Committees of its members for the purpose of examining matters of public importance, while the Thing is in session. The Chambers can empower such Committees to demand verbal or written information from public authorities as well as private individuals. 23. No tax can be imposed, altered, or abolished unless by law, nor can any loan binding on the country be negotiated, nor any landed property belonging to the country in any wise be disposed of, except by law. 24. No expense must be incurred, unless it is sanctioned by the financial law, or by a supplementary financial law. 25. To every ordinary Althing, as soon as it has assembled, are to be submitted the financial estimates for Iceland for the following financial period of two years. Under the head of revenue is included

the contribution, extraordinary as well as ordinary, which, in consequence of the 5th and 6th paragraphs of the Law of the 2nd of January, 1871, relating to the constitutional position of Iceland in the Kingdom, is granted out of the general revenues for the purpose of defraying the special expenses of Iceland, on the condition, however, that the expenses of the supreme local administration of Iceland and of the representation of the Government in the Althing in the manner decreed by the King, are, in. the first instance, to be paid out of the above fund. Expenses fixed in former laws, ordinances, Royal resolutions, or other valid edicts, are to be included in the estimates as well as in the financial law, and the amount thereof is not to be altered unless an additional sum is specially asked for or granted for that particular financial period. The financial estimates, as well as the supplementary financial estimates, are always to be submitted in the first instance to the Lower Chamber of the Althing. §26. Each of the Chambers of the Althing is to name a paid auditor. These auditors are to examine the annual budget of the revenue and expenditure of the country, and see that the whole revenue of the country is properly accounted for, and that no expenditure has been illegally incurred. They can demand all the information and documents they require. The two annual accounts of each financial period of two years are then to be thrown into one, which will be submitted to the Althing, accompanied by the remarks of the auditors, and after that it will receive the legal sanction. 27. No project of law can be finally passed before it has been read 3 times in each Chamber of the Althing. 28. After a project of law has been passed in one Chamber of the Althing, it is to be submitted to the other in the same form in which it has been passed. Should it be altered there, it is to be sent back to the former Chamber. Should it be again modified, the project is to be once more sent up to the other Chamber. Should the two Chambers be unable to come separately to an agreement, then they are both to hold a meeting in common, and to resolve the question by a single vote. In order that a measure passed by the Althing thus united should have force of law, it will be necessary that two-thirds of the members of each Chamber should be present, and should take part in the voting; the different clauses may be carried by a simple majority of votes, but the whole Bill, except in the case of the financial and supplementary financial Bills, will require at least a majority of two-thirds of the members present. §29. The Althing itself decides as to the validity of the election of its members.

30. Every new member takes the oath on the Constitutional Law after his election has been validated. §31. The Althingsmen are only bound by their own opinions, and not by those of their constituents. Functionaries, who are elected Althingsmen, do not require the assent of the Government to accept their election ; but they are bound to provide for the due performance of their official duties, without expense to the public Treasury, in such manner as may seem satisfactory to the Government. 32. As long as the Althing is assembled, no Althingsman can, without the consent of the Chamber of which he is a member, be arrested for debt, or imprisoned, or prosecuted unless he has been caught in flagrante delicto. No member can be called to account outside the Thing for what he says within it, unless the Chamber to which he belongs gives its consent. 33. If the member validly elected comes under one of those conditions which exclude him from election, he loses the right conferred by the election. 34. The Landsh6vding has, in virtue of his office, the right to be present in the Althing, and is entitled to take part in the discussions as often as he pleases, conforming however to the rule of the House. Besides the Landsh6vding another official may also be authorized by the Government to be present in the Thing, and to furnish it with the information which may be required. When the Landsh6vding is prevented from attending, some other person can be authorized to treat with the Thing. The Landshvding or his substitute is only entitled to vote, when he also happens to be an Althingsman. 35. Each of the Chambers, as well as the united Althing, chooses its President and Vice-President. 36. Neither of the two Chambers of the Thing can pass any measure unless two-thirds at least of the members are present and take part in the vote. 37. Every Althingsman can, with the consent of the Chamber of which he is a member, call attention to any public matter and demand explanations with respect to it. 38. No petition must be presented to either of the two Chambers of the Ting, except througb one of the members of the Chamber to which it is addressed. 39. The Chamber, if it does not wish to come to a decision on a petition, can refer it directly to the Landsh6vding or to the Minister. 40. The sittings of both Chambers and of the United Althing [1873-74. Lxv.] 3 Q

are public. The President, or such a number of members as is required by the rules of the House, can, however, demand that all those who are not concerned in the subject under discussion shall withdraw, and the House then decides whether the matter is to be discussed in a public or secret sitting. 41. The rules for the conduct of business in the United Thing, and in its two Chambers, are fixed by law. IV. 42. The judicial power can only be regulated by law. 43. The tribunals are empowered to decide every question as to the extent of the competency of the authorities. No one who raises a question of such a nature can, however, by bringing the case before the courts, avoid the obligation of temporarily submitting to the orders of the authorities. 41. The judges in office have only to administer the law. Judges, who are not at the same time entrusted with administrative functions, can only be dismissed by a sentence, nor can they be removed against their will, except in the case of the reorganization of the tribunals. The judge, however, who has completed his 65th year can be dismissed, but without loss of emoluments. V. 45. The Evangelic-Lutheran Church is the National Church of Iceland, and as such is supported and protected by the State. . 46. The citizens have the right to form congregations with the object of worshipping God in the manner conformable to their convictions, on the condition, however, that nothing is taught or done which is contrary to public order and morals. 47. No one can be deprived of the full enjoyment of his civil and political rights, or exempt himself from the fulfilment of any public duty on the plea of his creed. VI. 48. Any one, when arrested, is to be brought as soon as possible before a magistrate. If the person arrested cannot immediately be released, the magistrate is bound as soon as possible, at all events within 3 days after the person arrested has appeared before him, to issue an order, for which he is to state his grounds, deciding whether th6 person in custody is to be imprisoned, and, if he can be released on bail, fixing the kind and the amount of bail required. The person concerned can immediately appeal to the Superior Court against the magistrate's decision. No one can be detained in prison for a misdemeanour, which only renders him liable to a pecuniary fine or a simple arrest. 49. The citizen's domicile is inviolable. House searches and sequestrations of letters and other papers can only be resorted to in virtue of a warrant, unless sanctioned by some special law. 50. The right of possession is inviolable. No one can be compelled to cede his property, unless it should be required in the public interest. Such a measure can only be enforced in accordance with law, and after full compensation.

51. All restrictions on the right of earning money freely, and on a footing of absolute equality, which are not necessary for the welfare of all, are to be legally abolished. 52. Any one who cannot provide for himself and family, and whose support is not incumbent on any one else, is entitled to public relief; but has then to submit to all the obligations prescribed by law in such cases. 53. If parents are themselves unable to educate their children, or if the children are orphans and paupers, the State is bound to provide for their education. 54. Every one has the right to make known his opinions in print; but he is responsible to the tribunals. No censorship or other restrictive measures can ever be introduced. 55. The citizens have the right, without any obligation to obtain permission beforehand, to form associations for all legal purposes. No association can be dissolved by order of the Government. Associations can, however, be previously prohibited; but actions at law must in that case be at once brought against them in- order that they should be legally dissolved. 56. The citizens are entitled to assemble without arms. The police is entitled to be present at public meetings. Open-air meetings can be prohibited, when it is feared they may lead to a breach of the public peace. 57. Every man who is capable of bearing arms is bound to assist personally in the defence of the country, according to special rules, which are to be laid down by law. 58. The right of the communes to administer their affairs independently under the supervision of the Government is regulated by law. 59. The imposition of taxes is regulated by law. 60. Every prerogative which the legislation has held to be connected with nobility, title, or rank, is abolished. VII. 61. Motions for alterations in or additions to this Constitutional law can be brought forward at ordinary as well as at extraordinary Althings. If the motion for alterations in the Constitutional Law is adopted by both Chambers, the Althing is to be at once dissolved, and writs for new general elections are to be issued. If the new Althing ratifies the resolution without amendments, and it is confirmed by the King, it becomes valid as a Constitutional Law. 62. This Constitutional Law comes into force on the 1st of August, 1874, in conformity with the following provisional rules:
ProvisionalRules. 1. Until otherwise determined by law, the Electoral Law of the 6th of January, 1871, as well as the Ordinance of the 8th of March,

1843, with the exceptions resulting from the 14th, 17th, and 18th paragraphs of this present Law, remains still in vigour as regards the elections to the Althing. The number of Althingsmen elected by the people according to the first-named paragraph of this present Law, is, until otherwise determined by law, to be fixed so that the following districts ("syssels"), Gullbringe and Kjos, Arns, Rangarvalla, Skaptafels, Isafjords with the market town of Isafjord, Hunavatus, Skagafjords, (Efjords with the market town of Akureyri, ThingS, Nordurmula, and Sudurmula, will each elect two Althingsmen, while the other districts, and the market town of Reykjavik, will each elect but one. 2. Until the law referred to in the third paragraph is published, accusations brought by the Althing against the Minister for Iceland for violations of the Constitutional Law are to be tried before the Supreme Court of the Kingdom, according to the rules of procedure laid down for that Court. 3. Till rules for the proceedings of the United Althing and its two Chambers are established by law, power is reserved to the King to settle the provisional order of their proceedings. 4. The King issues the requisite orders, so that the Constitutional Law may enter into vigour during the year 1875. The estimates of the revenue and expenditure of Iceland during the year 1875 are to be fixed by the King, according to the rules hitherto observed. Given at Amalienborg, January 5tb, 1874, under our Royal hand and seal. (L.S.) CHRISTIAN R. C. A. KLEIN, Minister of the Interior.
