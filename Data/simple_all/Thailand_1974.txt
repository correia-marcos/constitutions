CONSTITUTION OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
Somdet Phra Paramintharamaha Bhumibol Adulyadej Sayammintharathirat Borommanatthabophit Enacted on the 7th day of October B.E. 25171 Being the 29th year of the Present Reign. May there be virtue. Today is the sixth day of the waning moon in the eleventh month of the year of Tiger under the lunar calendar, being Monday, the seventh day of October under the solar calendar, in the 2517th year of the Buddhist Era. Be it proclaimed by the King that He is advised by the National Legislative Assembly that the grant of the Constitution of Thailand on 10th December B.E, 2475 by His Majesty King Prajadhipok Phra Pok Klao Chao Yu Hua, His Majesty's Uncle, was the founding of a democratic system of government in Thailand, it being His unwavering desire to grant to all the Thai people and not any particular group or party the power to administer the State affairs while the King was to be Head of State and to exercise the sovereign power which belongs to the people under the provisions of the Constitution. More than forty years having since passed, the changes of situation in the country resulted in the amendments of the Constitution and promulgation of new Constitutions on several occasions, and sometimes it was necessary that an interim Constitution was promulgated, pending the drafting of a permanent Constitution. Consequently, the country was not governed in accordance with the proper democratic system during such periods. However, as time passed, the people who have gained wider education and better political knowledge and thoughts have been increasingly more alert and desirous to participate in the administration of the country. The people, being dissatisfied with the administration of the State affairs, therefore, demanded on 13th and 14th October B.E. 2516 that a Constitution be granted as soon as possible. Students, undergraduates, .people and newspapers had a significant role in making strong public opinion in this matter. In the demonstration of public opinion at that time, many lives were lost and much blood was shed, which was a very serious political crisis resulting in the resignation of the then government and the appointment of the new government. In response to the prevailing public desire, the Cabinet then appointed a Constitution Drafting Commission to draft a permanent Constitution. After the draft was completed, the Cabinet considered and submitted it to the National Legislative Assembly which is composed of members appointed by the King from the members of the National Congress. The National Legislative Assembly then appointed an ad hoc committee to consider the draft Constitution. After having

considered it, the committee submitted it to the National Legislative Assembly for consideration once again. in the consideration of this draft Constitution, the Constitution Drafting Commission appointed by the Cabinet, the Cabinet, the ad hoc committee to consider the draft Constitution of the National Legislative Assembly, and the National Legislative Assembly have throughout taken public opinion into account in order to make this Constitution compatible with the desire of the people. The objectives of this Constitution demonstrate the common desire of the Thai people that they will uphold the national independence in every way, protect all religions that they may be lasting, respect the King as Head and Symbol of the Nation, adhere to the democratic system of government, enact laws for social justice, take all measures to narrow and eliminate step by step the economic and social gaps between the individuals, co-operate in the relief of grievance and the promotion of happiness, protect the rights and liberties of all people equally, and uphold the rule of law, in order that justice may be accorded to all people. Further, the National Legislative Assembly is of the opinion that the administration of the State affairs in accordance with the objectives of this Constitution may be realized only when all people believe that the democratic system of government is a good system and is suitable for the country, which will bring happiness to all people. Consequently, it is necessary for the people to participate in the administration of government by truly respecting the objectives of this Constitution, to be ready to sacrifice their personal happiness for common benefit, as well as to sacrifice their lives and blood for the protection of the democratic system of government when it is necessary to do so. The National Legislative Assembly, after having carefully examined and revised the draft Constitution, passed a resolution approving it, and presented it to the King for His Royal Signature in order to promulgate it as the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand. The King, after having thoroughly examined the draft Constitution, deems it expedient to grant it His Royal Assent in accordance with the advice and consent of the National Legislative Assembly. Be it, therefore, commanded by the King that the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand be promulgated to replace, as from the date of its promulgation, the Constitution of the Kingdom B.E. 2515 which was promulgated on 15th December B.E. 2515. May the Thai people be united in protecting the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand in order to uphold the democratic system of government and the sovereign power of the Thai people in this country, and in order that happiness, Prosperity and dignity may be bestowed on His people in accordance with the a spiration of the King in every respect.
