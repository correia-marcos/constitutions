THE CONSTITUTION of the FRENCH REPUBLIC
Adopted by the National Constituent Assembly September 28, 1946
PREAMBLE On the morrow of the victory of the free peoples over the r√©gimes that attempted to enslave and degrade the human person, the French people proclaims once more that every human being, without distinction of race, religion, or belief, possesses inalienable and sacred rights. It solemnly reaffirms the rights and freedoms of man and of the citizen consecrated by the Declaration of Rights of 1789 and the fundamental principles recognized by the laws of the Republic. It further proclaims as most vital in our time the following political, economic and social principles: The law guarantees to women equal rights with men in ail domains. Anyone persecuted because of his activities in the cause of freedom has the right of asylum within the territories of the Republic. Everyone has the duty to work and the right to obtain employment. No one may suffer in his work or his employment because of his origin, his opinions, or his beliefs. Everyone may defend his rights and interests by trade-union action and may join the union of his choice. The right to strike may be exercised within the frame work of the laws that govern it. Every worker through his delegates may participate in collective bargaining to determine working conditions, as well as in the management of business. Al property and all enterprises that now have or subsequently shall have the character of a national public service or a monopoly ip fact must become the property of the community. The nation ensures to the individual and the family the conditions necessary to their development. It guarantees to all, and notably to the child, the mother, and the aged worker, health protection, material security, rest, and leisure. Every human being who, because of his age, his physical or mental condition, or because of the economic situation, finds himself unable to work, has the right to obtain from the community the means to lead a.decent existence. The nation proclaims the solidarity and equality of all Frenchmen with regard to the burdens resulting from national disasters.

The nation guarantees equal access of children and adults to education, professional training, and culture. The establishment of free, secular, public education on all levels is a duty of the state. The French Republic, faithful to its traditions, abides by the rules of international law. It will not undertake wars of conquest and will never use its arms against the freedom of any people. On condition of reciprocity, France accepts the limitations of sovereignty necessary to the organization and defense of peace. France forms with the people of its overseas territories a union based upon equality of rights and duties without distinction of race or religion. The French Union is composed of nations and peoples who wish to place in common or co-ordinate their resources and their efforts in order to develop their civilization, increase their well-being, and ensure their security. Faithful to her traditional mission, France proposes to guide the peoples for whom she has assumed responsibility toward freedom to govern themselves and democratically to manage their own affairs; putting aside any system of colonization based upon arbitrary power, she guarantees to al equal access to public office and the individual or collective exercise of the rights and liberties proclaimed or confirmed above.

Art. 1. Men are born and remain free and equal in respect of rights. Social distinctions shall be based solely upon public utility. Art. 2. The purpose of all civil associations is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. Art. 3. The nation is essentially the source of al sovereignty; nor shall any body of men or any individual exercise authority which is not expressly derived from it. Art. 4. Liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure another. Accordingly, the exercise of the natural rights of every man has no other limits than those which are necessary to secure to every other man the free exercise of the same rights; and these limits are determinable only by the law.
Art. 5. The law ought to prohibit only actions hurtful to society. What is not prohibited by the law should not be hindered; nor should any one be compelled to do that which the law does not require. Art. 6. The law is an expression of the common will. All citizens have a right to concur, either personally or by their representation, in its formation. It should be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes; and all, being equal in its sight, are equally eligible to all honours, places, and employments, according to their different abilities, without any other distinction than that of their virtues and talents. Art. 7. No one shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned, save in the cases determined by law, and according to the forms which it has prescribed. All who solicit, promote, execute, or cause to be executed, arbitrary orders, ought to be punished, and every citizen summoned or apprehended by virtue of the law, ought immediately to obey, and becomes culpable if he resists. Art. 8. The law should impose only such penalties as are absolutely and evidently necessary; and no one ought to be punished but by virtue of a law promulgated before the offence, and legally applied. Art. 9. Every man being counted innocent until he has been convicted, whenever his arrest becomes indispensable, all rigour more than is necessary to secure his person ought to be provided against by law. Art. 10. No man is to be interfered with because of his opinions, not even because of religious opinions, provided his avowal of them does not disturb public order as established by law. Art. 11. The unrestrained communication of thoughts or opinions being one of the most precious rights of man, every citizen may speak, write and publish freely, provided he be responsible for the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by law. Art. 12. A public force being necessary to give security to the rights of men and of citizens, that force is instituted for the benefit of the community, and not for the particular benefit of the person to whom it is entrusted. Art. 13. A common contribution being necessary for the support of the public force, and for defraying the other expenses of government, it should be divided equally among the members of the community, according to their abilities. Art. 14. Every citizen has a right, either of himself or his representative, to a free voice in determining the necessity of public contributions, the appropriation of them, and their amount, mode of assessment, and duration. Art. 15. The community has the right to demand of all its agents an account of their conduct. Art. 16. Every community in which a security of rights and a separation of powers is not provided for needs a constitution. Art. 17. The right to property being inviolable and sacred, no one shall be deprived of it, except in cases of evident public necessity, legally ascertained, and on condition of a previous just indemnity.
