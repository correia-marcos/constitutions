Article 36: 
Should a bill be returned as unconstitutional or altogether inexpedient and one of the Houses declare the objections made by the President of the Confederation to be well-founded, the bill shall be placed in the archives and may not be reconsidered during that session. If both Houses declare the objections of the President of the Confederation to be ill-founded, the bill shall be returned; in this event the President may not refuse to sanction it. 
Article 37:
If the objections of the President of the Confederation apply to only one or several of the provisions of the bill, and both Houses declare the objections to be well-founded wholly or in part, then the bill shall be reconsidered and the necessary modifications of that portion or portions to which the objections refer shall be made. Should the modifications adopted be in accord with the proposals made by the President of the Confederation, he may not refuse to sanction it; but if they are not so, or any new provisions are introduced, or any deleted which were not objected to by him, the President may offer new objections to the bill. If one of the Houses declares the objections to be ill-founded and the other House declares the contrary, the bill shall be placed in the archives.

If the insistence should refer to the entire bill, and on its repetition the other House should not agree to it, the bill shall be tabled and may not be reconsidered during the session of that year. This does not prevent one or more of the provisions of a rejected bill from forming part of any new bill that may be introduced.
