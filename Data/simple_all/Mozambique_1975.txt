ARTICLE 2 The People's Republic of Mozambique is a State based on people's democracy in which all patriotic strata engage in building a new society, free from the exploitation of man by man. In the People's Republic of Mozambique power belongs to the workers and peasants united and led by FRELIMO, and is exercised by the organs of people's power. ARTICLE 3 The People's Republic of Mozambique is guided by the political line laid down by FRELIMO, which is the leading force of the State and Society. FRELIMO lays down the basic political orientation of the State and directs and supervises the work of state organs, in order to ensure that the State policy is in conformity with the people's interests. ARTICLE 4 The People's Republic of Mozambique has the following fundamental objectives: -the elimination of colonial and traditional structures of oppression and exploitation and the mentality that underlies them; -the extension and strengthening of people's democratic power; -the building of an independent economy and the promotion of cultural and social progress; -the defence and consolidation of national independence and unity; -the establishment and development of friendly relations and cooperation with other peoples and States; -the pursuit of the struggle against colonialism and imperialism. -1-

ARTICLE 5 As an essential element of State power, the Mozambique People's Liberation Forces have a fundamental responsibility for the defence and consolidation of national independence and unity. At the same time, they are a force for production and for the political mobilisation of the masses of the people. The activity and development of the Mozambique People's Liberation Forces are based on FRELIMO's political leadership and on close links with the people. Participation in the Mozambique People's Liberation Forces, with its great tradition of struggle, heroism and identification with the revolutionary cause of the people, is an honour and a sacred duty for all citizens, of both sexes, of the People's Republic of Mozambique. The Commander-in-Chief of the Mozambique People's Liberation Forces is the President of FRELIMO. The Commander-in-Chief of the Mozambique People's Liberation Forces has the power to appoint or dismiss top level military cadres. ARTICLE 6 The People's Republic of Mozambique, taking agriculture as the base and industry as the propelling and decisive factor, directs its economic policy towards wiping out underdevelopment and creating conditions for raising the living standards of the working people. In pursuing this aim, the State essentially relies on the creative force of the people and on the country's economic resources, giving total support to agricultural production, promoting adequate development of productive enterprises, and undertaking the exploitation of natural resources. In the process of building an advanced economic base for the People's Republic of Mozambique, the State shall proceed to eliminate the exploitation of man by man. ARTICLE 7 In the People's Republic of Mozambique work is esteemed and protected, and is the driving force of development. Work is the right and duty of every citizen of either sex, and it is the criterion for the distribution of national wealth.

The State determines the conditions of their development and use.
