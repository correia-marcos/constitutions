TITLE

I

The Territory of the Republic Art. 1. The Republic of Haiti is one, indivisible, sovereign, independent democratic, and social. Port-au-Prince is its Capital and the seat of its Government. This seat may be moved elsewhere according to circumstances. All adjacent islands, of which the principal ones are: La Tortue, la Gonave, l'Ile-a-Vache, les Cayemittes, la Navase, la Grande Caye and all those within the boundaries established by international law, are an integral part of the territory of the Republic, which is inviolable and inalienable. Art. 2. The territory of the Republic of Haiti is divided into Departments. The Departments are subdivided into Arrondissements, the

Arrondisements into Communes, and the Communes into Quartiers (wards) and Rural Sections. The number and the boundaries of these divisions and subdivisions are determined by law, which also regulates their organization and functioning
TITLE II

Chapter I. Rights Art. 3. The aggregate of civil and political rights constitutes citizenship. The exercise of these rights is regulated by law. Art. 4. Every Haitian, regardless of sex, who has attained 21 years of age, exercises political rights if he fulfills the other conditions prescribed by the Constitution and by law. Nevertheless, the right of women to vote shall temporarily be exercised only in voting for or holding office in municipal positions. The law shall provide for full and complete exercise of all political rights by women within a period not to exceed three years after the next general municipal elections. Upon the expiration of this period, no impediment may prevent the exercise of these rights. Women's fitness for all civil positions in the Public Administration is recognized. However, the law regulates the conditions to which women shall be temporarily subject with respect to family affairs and marriage, leaving open the possibility for any changes deemed expedient to attain a system of absolute equality between the sexes. Art. 5. The regulations concerning nationality are determined by law. Aliens may acquire Haitian nationality by conforming to the regulations established by law. Naturalized Haitians are not permitted to exercise political rights until ten years after the date of their naturalization. Art. 6. Every alien within Haitian territory enjoys the same protection that is accorded to Haitians, except for measures that might be found to be necessary against nationals of countries where Haitians do not enjoy the same protection. Art. 7. The exercise, enjoyment, suspension, and loss of political rights are regulated by law. Art. 8. The right to own real property is accorded to aliens residing in Haiti for their residential needs. I [However, an alien residing in Haiti may not become the owner of more than one dwelling in a single locality. He may not, in any case, engage in the business of renting real estate. Nevertheless, foreign building-construction companies shall have the benefit of a special statute regulated by law. The right to own real property is likewise accorded to aliens residing in Haiti and to foreign companies for the needs of their agricultural, commercial, industrial, or educational enterprises, within the limits and under the conditions	 prescribed by law.

This right shall terminate within a period of two years after an alien has ceased to reside in the country or the operations of such companies have ceased, according to the law that prescribed the: regulations to be followed for the transfer and liquidation of property belonging to aliens. Every citizen is competent to denounce violations of these provisions.

Chapter II. Public Right
Art. 9. Haitians are equal before the law, subject to the restrictions that may be imposed by law with respect to naturalized Haitians. Every Haitian has the right to take an effective part in the government of his country, to hold public office or to be appointed to State positions, without distinction as to color, sex or religion. The administration of the Public Services of the State, with respect to appointments, terms, and conditions of service, must be free from any privilege, favor, or discrimination. Art. 10. The State guarantees the right of all persons within the territory of the Republic to life and liberty. No one may be prosecuted, arrested, or detained except in the cases determined by law and in accordance with legally prescribed forms. No arrest or detention shall take place except by order of a legally competent official. For the execution of such an order, it is necessary: 1. that it formally state the reason for the detention and the provision of law that punishes the act charged; 2. that it be made known legally and that a copy be left with the accused â€¢ person at the time of execution, except in case of flagrante delicto. Any force or restraint that is not necessary for the apprehension or detention of a person, any moral pressure or physical abuse, especially during interrogation, is forbidden. The injured parties may appeal to the competent Courts, without previous authorization, to prosecute either the principals or agents. Art. 11. No one may be denied access to the Judges whom the Constitution or the law assigns to him. A civilian is never amenable to a Military Court, nor shall a military person, in exclusively civil matters, be denied access to a court of ordinary law, except in case of a legally declared state of siege. Art. 12. No search of the home or seizure of papers may take place except by virtue of law and in accordance with legally prescribed forms. Art. 13. The law shall have no retroactive effect, except in penal matters when it is favorable to the offender. A law is considered retroactive whenever it takes away acquired rights. Art. 14. No penalty may be established except by law, or applied except in the cases determined by law. Art. 15. The right to own property is guaranteed, although expropriation for a legally-established reason of public use may take place in consideration of the payment or appropriation of a just and prior indemnity by judgment of court to the order of the person entitled thereto.

But property also entails obligations. It may not be used contrary to the general interest. An owner of land must cultivate, work, and protect the soil, especially against erosion. The penalty for violation of this obligation is provided by law. The right of ownership does not extend to springs, rivers, water courses, mines, and quarries. These are a part of the public domain of the State. The owner of land containing springs, rivers, mines, and quarries shall be entitled to a just and prior indemnity exclusively for the land in the event of its use or exploitation by the State or its concessionaires. The conditions of use or exploitation are determined by law. Art. 16. Freedom to work is exercised under the control and supervision of the State and is regulated by law. However, save for those exceptions and distinctions established by law all importers, commission agents, and manufacturers' agents are prohibited from engaging in retail trade, even through an intermediary. The law shall define what is meant by an intermediary. Art. 17. Every worker has the right to a fair wage, to training through apprenticeship, to the protection of his health, to social security, and to the well-being of his family to the extent that the economic development of the country permits. It is the moral obligation of employers to contribute, according to their means, to the education of their illiterate workers. Every worker has the right to participate, through his delegates, in the collective determination of working conditions and to protect his interests through trade-union action. Annual vacations with pay are compulsory. Art. 18. Capital punishment may not be established in political matters, except for the crime of treason. The crime of treason consists, for Haitians, of taking up arms for a foreign State against the Republic of Haiti, of adhering to such State, or of giving it aid and comfort. Art. 19. Everyone has the right to express his opinions on any matter and by any means within his power. The expression of thought, whatever form it takes, may not be subjected to any censorship, except when war has been declared. Abuses of the right of expression are defined and punished by law. Art. 20. All religions and faiths recognized in Haiti are free. Everyone has the right to profess his religion, or to exercise his faith, provided he does not disturb public order. The Catholic religion, professed by the majority of Haitians, enjoys a special position as a result of the Concordat. Art. 21. As marriage tends to purity of morals by contributing to a better organization of the family, the fundamental basis of society, it shall be the duty of the State to adopt every possible and necessary means Ii tofaciltaeitandencourageits pread mongthep ople, specialyinthe rualcs. Art, 22. Freedom of education is exercised according to law, under

the control and supervision of the State, which should take an interest in the moral and civic training of youth. Public education is a responsibility of the State and of the Communes. Elementary education is compulsory. Public education is free in all grades. Technical and vocational instruction should be extended. Access to higher studies should be open to all on an equal basis, according to merit. Art. 23. The jury, in the cases designated by law, is established in criminal matters. Political offenses committed through the press or otherwise shall be tried by a jury. Art. 24. Haitians have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms, even for the discussion of political affairs, in conformity with the laws which regulate the exercise of this right, no requirement of prior authorization, however, being necessary. This provision does not apply to public gatherings, which remain entirely subject to police laws. Art. 25. Haitians have the right to associate, and to form political parties, labor unions, and cooperatives. This right may not be subjected to any preventive measure. And no one may be compelled to join an association or a political party. The law regulates the conditions for the functioning of these groups and fixes the manner of controlling the funds of labor unions. Art. 26. The right of petition is exercised personally by one or more individuals, never in the name of a group. Art. 27. The secrecy of letters is inviolable under penalties (for violations) prescribed by law. Art. 28. French is the official language. Its use is obligatory in the public services. Art. 29. The right of asylum is accorded to political refugees, with the condition that they conform to the law. Art. 30. Extradition will be neither granted nor requested for political matters. Art. 31. The law may neither add to nor derogate from the Constitution. The letter of the Constitution should always prevail.

The Council of Government is authorized, according to circumstances and under conditions prescribed by law, to call in for advice and discussion any experts, technicians or specialists who by their knowledge and experience may be in a position to guide and support it in the accomplishment of its task, or even to utilize their services.

The President of the Republic appoints the Judges of the Courts (Cours and Tribunaux). He appoints and recalls the officials of the Public Ministry under the Court of Cassation, the Courts of Appeal and the other permanent Courts, as well as the Justices of Peace and their alternates. The Judges of the Court of Cassation and Courts of Appeal are appointed for ten years, and those of the Civil Courts for seven years. Their terms begin to run from the time of taking the oath. Judges, once appointed, are not subject to removal by the Executive Power for any reason whatsoever. However, they remain subject to the provisions of articles 112, 113, and 114 of the present Constitution and to the provisions of special laws specifying the grounds which may terminate their functions.

The Courts of ordinary law and Peace Courts shall retain jurisdiction over litigation which is vested in them by law. Art. 104. The Court of Cassation does not rule on the merits of cases. Neverthless, in all matters, aside from those submitted to the jury, whenever upon a second appeal, even upon an exception, the same matter is presented by the same parties, the Court of Cassation, in accepting the

case, will not order remand but will rule on the merits of the case, sitting as a full court. However, in the case of appeals from temporary restraining orders or orders of examining magistrates, grants of appeal issued as a result of such orders, or from final sentences of the Peace Courts and sentences of the Land Courts, the Court of Cassation, in accepting the appeal, will decide without remand. Art. 105. The office of judge is incompatible with any other salaried public office. The law regulates the conditions requisite for being a judge of any rank. Art. 106. Commercial disputes are referred to Civil and Peace Courts in conformity with the Commercial Code. Art. 107.

Art. 109. Decrees or judgments are rendered and executed in the name of the Republic. They are binding on the officers of the Public Ministry and agents of the Public Force. The records of notaries are issued in the same form whenever they have compulsory force. Art. 110. The Court of Cassation rules on jurisdictional conflicts in the manner prescribed by law. It takes cognizance of the facts and the law in all cases of decisions rendered by the Military Court. Art. 111. The Court of Cassation, when a case is litigated and remanded, rules in full court on the constitutionality of laws. The remedy for unconstitutionality is not subject to any requirement of deposit, penalty or tax. The interpretation given by the Legislative Chambers will be applied to the case without retroactive change of rights acquired by previous final judgment. The Courts will apply the decrees and regulations of the public administration only in so far as they conform to the laws. Chapter V. Proceedings against Members of the State Powers Art. 112.

No one may be judged or convicted except by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Senate. The limits prescribed by article 50 of the Constitution for the duration of the sessions of the Legislative Body do not terminate the proceedings of the Senate sitting as a High Court of Justice. Art. 113. In case of grave breach of trust, any Judge or Officer of the Public Ministry is impeached by one of the Sections of the Court of Cassation. If any entire Court is involved, the impeachment is pronounced by the Court of Cassation sitting as a full court. Art. 114. The law regulates the manner of proceeding against the President of the Republic, the Secretaries of State, and Judges in the case of crimes or misdemeanors committed by them, either within or outside the performance of their duties. Art. 115. The law shall fix the extent of responsibility of either the State or of an official with respect to arbitrary acts performed in violation of the Constitution or the laws, and which have caused prejudice to third parties.
