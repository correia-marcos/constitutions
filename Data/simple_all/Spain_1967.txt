FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE STATE
THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION

MADRID, 1967

II. FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE STATE

The Organic Law of the State (1/1957) of 10th January FBoletin Oficial del Estado (Official State Bulletin) No. 9, of 11th January) established in its Fourth Transitory Disposition that "within a period of four months as from the promulgation of the present Law, there shall be published the revised texts of the Fundamental Laws, which shall contain the amendments referred to in the additional Provisions of the present Law, after their sanction by the Council of the Realm and their debate by the Council of Ministers". The fundamental character of the Laws to be revised and the permanent nature and unalterability of the principles that inspire them, as proclaimed by Law on 17th May, 1958, and reiterated in the Organic Law of the State, demand that the task of revision must be limited to substituting in the Funr damental Laws the texts amended by the additional Provisions of the Organic Law of the State, deleting them in the revised draft of said Law and, consequently, reflecting in the exposition of motives of the Fuero de los Espanales (Statute Law of the Spanish People), of the Law of the Cortes and of the Law of Succession, the amendments that have been effected in the particular section. Finally, the Fundamental Laws have been arranged systematically and not in the chronological order of their promulgation. In virtue of the fulfilment of the requirements of the aforecited Transitory Regulation, the sanction of the Council of the Realm, and the debate of the Council of Ministers, at their session of the 14th day of April.

I RESOLVE: Article One That the appended revised texts of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom be approved.

Article Two That the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom continue without interruption during the entire period of their enforcement, in the form contained in the Revised Texts, there being derogated whatever dispositions there may be in opposition to the provisions established in said Laws. I so resolve by the present Decree given at El Pardo on the twentieth day of April nineteen hundred and sixty-seven.

LAW ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT of 17th May, 1958

I, FRANCISCO FRANCO BAHAMONDE, CAUDILLO OF SPAIN Mindful of my responsibility before God and before History and in the presence of the Cortes of the Kingdom, promulgate the following Principles of the National Movement, as a communion of Spaniards dedicated to the ideals that gave birth to the Crusade:

Spain is a unit of destiny on a universal plane. Service to the unit, to the greatness and liberty of the country is the sacred duty and the 'collective task of every Spaniard.

The Spanish nation regards as a badge of honour its respect for the Law of God, according to the doctrine of the Holy Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church, the one true and inseparable faith of the national conscience, which inspires the legislation of the country.

Spain, the root of a great family of peoples, whose ties of brotherhood are indissoluble, aspires to the restoration of justice and peace among nations.

Iv The unity between the peoples and, the domains of Spain is intangible. The integrity of the country and its independence are the supreme exigencies of the national community. The Armed Forces of Spain, the guarantee of her security and the expression of the heroic virtues of her people, must possess the strength necessary for the better service of the country.

V The national community is founded on man, the bearer of eternal values, and on the family, the basis of society; but individual and collective interests must be always subordinate to the common good of the Nation, constituted by generations past, present and future. The Law upholds in equal measure the rights of every Spaniard. VI The natural entities of social life: the Family, the Municipality and the Trade Union, are the basic structures of the national community. The various institutions and corpoi-ations which meet the needs of society in general must be protected, so that they may participate efficaciously in achieving the ends of the national community.

VII The. Spanish people, united by Law and order, cognizant of the postulates of authority, liberty and service, constitute the National State. Their political system is, within the immutable principles of the National Movemeni and the 2

provisions of the Law of Succession and the other Fundamental Laws, a traditional, Catholic, social and representative Monarchy. VIII The representative character of the political system is the basic principle of our public institutions. The participation of the people in the legislative and other functions of general interest shall be implemented through the family, the municipality, the Trade Union and other organically representative bodies recognized by law for this purpose. Any political organization whatever outside this representative system shall be deemed illegal. Every Spaniard has the right of access to public office according to his merit and capacity.

IX Every Spaniard has the right to: impartial adjudication, which shall be free for those lacking economic means; a general and vocational education, which shall never be denied for lack of material means; the benefits of social security and assistance, and an equitable share of the national income and fiscal levies. The Christian ideal of social justice, reflected in the Labour Law, shall inspire the politics and the laws of the nation.

X Work is regarded as the fount of hierarchy, duty and honour for the Spanish people, and private property, in all its forms, as a right conditional on its social function. Private initiative, the foundation of economic activity, must 3

be stimulated, channelled and, if necessary, subsidized by the State, XI Commercial enterprise, the association of men and means geared to production, constitutes a community of interests and a unity of purpose. The relations between the members of the commercial firm must be based on justice and on mutual loyalty, and economic values shall be subordinate to those of a human and social order.

XII The State shall endeavour, by all the means at its disposal, to perfect the physical and moral health of the people, and to ensure for them the highest standards of working conditions; to stimulate the economic progress of the Nation with improvements in agriculture, the expansion of irrigation projects and agrarian reform; to direct the most equitable employment and distribution of public credit; to safeguard and promote the prospecting and exploitation of the mineral resources of the country; to intensify the process of industrialization; to support scientific research; and to protect maritime activities, according to the needs of the entire maritime population and the executive department of the Navy. IN VIRTUE OF WHICH, I RESOLVE:

Article One The Principles contained in the present decree, the synthesis of those inspiring the Fundamental Laws legalized by the Nation on the sixth day of July nineteen hundred 4

and forty-seven, are, by their very nature, permanent and unalterable.

Article Two
All organs and authorities shall be bound to the strictest observance of these Principles. The oath required for investiture with public office shall refer to the text of these Fundamental Principles.

Article Three
All laws and dispositions of whatever nature that injure or defame the Principles proclaimed in the present Fundamental Law of the Rea[m shall be null and void.

STATUTE LAW OF THE SPANISH PEOPLE (Fuero de los Espaholes) of 17th July, 1945, amended by the. Organic Law of the State of 10th January, 1967

I, FRANCISCO FRANCO BAHAMONDE, THE ARMED FORCES OF THE NATION:

CAUDILLO OF

SPAIN, HEAD OF STATE AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF

Whereas the Spanish Cortes, as the highest organ of participation by the people in the affairs of the State, have, in accordance with the I aw of their creation, drawn up the Fuero de los Espatio/es (Statute Law of the Spanish People), the fundamental text defining the rights and duties of the Spanish people and protecting their guarantees; and bearing in mind, as is the case in the Labour Law, that its principal provisions verify the permanent value of the concept that inspires them and that a large number of its declarations and precepts constitute a faithful adherence to Catholic social doctrine, recently brought up to date by the II Vatican Council and, finally, in view of the amendment introduced in Article Six thereof by the Organic Law of the State, approved subsequent to a national referendum, for the purpose of adapting its text to the declaration of the Council on religious freedom, promulgated on 1st December, 1965, which exacts explicit recognition of this right, in accordance with the second of the Fundamental Principles of the Movement, which stipulates that the doctrine of the Church shall inspire Spanish legislation. 9

I HEREBY RESOLVE THE FOLLOWING: Article The Fuero de los Espatioles, the text of which appears hereinafter, is hereby approved, with the character of a Fundamental Law prescribing the rights and duties of the Spanish people. PRELIMINARY TITLE Article One The Spanish State proclaims as the ruling principle of its acts respect for the dignity, the integrity and the liberty of the human person, recognizing man, the bearer of eternal values and the member of a national community, as the possessor of duties and rights, the exercise of which duties and rights guarantees in an orderly manner the common good'. TITLE 1 DUTIES AND RIGHTS OF THE SPANISH PEOPLE CHAPTER I Article Two All Spaniards owe faithful service to their country, loyalty to the Head of State and obedience to the laws of the nation 2.

The entire Spanish juridical system is based on this principle. 2 See Law on Fundamental Principles, I. The Spanish juridical system is based on this principle.

Article Three The Law protects in equal measure the rights of every Spaniard, without preference in respect of classes and without favour in respect of persons 3.

Article Five Every Spaniard has the right to receive education and instruction and the duty to acquire such education and instruction, either in the family home, or in private or public centres, according to his free choice. The State shall ensure that no talent shall be neglected for lack of economic means 5.

2 See Law on Fundamental Principles, V & IX. The Spanish juridical system is based on this principle. In respect of personal and family honour, Title X of the existing Penal Code, revised by Decree of 28th March, 1963, covers offences against honour. 5 See Law on Fundamental Principles, IX. Decree 193/1967, of 2nd February, prescribes regulations governing obligatory provisions and grants (Articles 12 and 13). The Law on Educational Grants of 19th July, 1944, recognizes, in Article 2 thereof, as entitled to educational grants "every Spaniard morally and intellectually fit to undertake studies, and especially, those lacking the economic means necessary to pursue their profession". Law 45/1960, of 21st July, created the National Fund for Promoting the Principle of Equality of Opportunity.

Article Seven Bearing arms in the service of their country is a mark of honour for the Spanish people. All Spaniards are obliged to render this service when called upon to do so within the provisions of the Law 7.

a See Law on Fundamental Principles and the Law regulating the exercise of civil rights and religious freedom, of 26th June, 1967. Formerly, non-Catholics only had the right of not being molested for their religious beliefs, and any external manifestations other than those of the Catholic cult were not allowed; now the State guarantees the defence and protection of religious freedom, within the safe-guard of morals and public order, in accordance with the ruling of the II Vatican Council. The Head of State, in his address on the occasion of presenting the Organic Law, pointed out that the new text of this article had received the approval of the Holy See.

LABOUR LAW (FUERO DEL TRABAJO). of 9th March, 1938 amended by the Organic Law of the State of 10th January, 1967

Following the Catholic tradition of social justice and the high sense of human values that informed the legislation of our glorious past, the State assumes the task of offering to every Spaniard the guarantee of a country, the means of, survival and justice. In order to achieve this aim â at the same time, fortifying the unity, the liberty and the greatness of Spain â it operates at the social level with the desire to place the wealth of the nation at the service of the Spanish people, subordinating the economy to the dignity of the human person, mindful of his material needs and the demands of his intellectual, moral, spiritual and religious life. And in the light of its conception of Spain as a unit of destiny, it makes manifest, through the present declarations, its design that the produce of Spain, within the bonds of brotherhood that unite all its elements, should constitute a unit of service towards the strengthening of the country and for the common good of all Spaniards. The Spanish State sets forth these declarations, which shall inspire her social and economic policy, under the precepts of justice and with the desire and determination that those who have laboured for the country constitute, by virtue of their honour, valour and work, the highest aristocracy of this national epoch. Before the Spanish people, irrevocably united in sacrifice and hope, we declare: 1. Work is the participation of man in production through the voluntary exercise of his intellectual and manual

23

faculties, according to his particular vocation, in keeping with the decorum and comfort of his life, and for the better development of the national economy''. 2. By virtue of its essentially personal and human nature, labour cannot be reduced to a material concept of merchandise, nor be the object of any transaction incompatible with the personal dignity of the worker''. 3. The right to work is a consequence of the duty imposed on man by God, for the fulfilment of his individual aims and the prosperity and greatness of the country. 4. The State values and exalts labour, the fruitful expression of the creative spirit of man, and in this sense, shall protect it with the force of law, giving it the highest consideration and making it compatible with the fulfilment of the other individual, family and social ends of life 38. 5. Work, as a social duty, shall be demanded, in some form or another, of every able-bodied Spaniard, and shall be considered a compulsory tribute to the national patrimony ". 6. Labour is one of the most noble attributes of hierar-

"

This definition of work is to be found in Article 1 of the Decree

of 26th January, 1944, which approves the revised text of the Law on the Contracting of Labour. See Fuero de los Espaholes (Statute Law of the Spanish People), Article 25. With the single purpose of honouring merit in work, the Royal Decree of 22nd January, 1926, created the Medal of Labour, re-established by Decree of 14th March, 1942. The protection of labour is manifested, among other ways, through fiscal reductions; perhaps the most characteristic form is that of the general tax on the income of persons (Income Law of 8th April, 1967).

chy and honour, and is sufficient in itself to demand the assistance and protection of the State'''. 7. Service is work undertaken with heroism, disinterest or self-sacrifice, with a will to contribute to the higher good that Spain represents. 8. Every Spaniard has the right to work. The execution of this right is a fundamental mission of the State 41.

44' This type of assistance is expounded the Social Security regulations

(Law of 28th December, complete text Decree of 21st April, 1956) and the provisions of the Labour Mutuality, and, in general, all the activities of the Ministry of Labour are linked with it. See; Fuero de los Espanoles (Statute Law of Spaniards), Article 29. ' 41 See Fuero de los Espanoles, Article 24. The/ Law on the Maximum Number. of Working Hours, of 9th September, 1931, is still in force. It fixes, as a maximum, a working day of eight hours or 48 hours a week, in accordance with the Washington Agreement of 29th October, 1929. This general norm is applied to the different fields df endeavour by the respective Labour Regulations. The work of women and children is regulated in Articles 162-179 of the Law on the Contracting of Labour; Article 4 of the Law on the Rights of Women, of 22nd July, 1961, and Decree of 26th July, i957, which indicates the different types of work prohibited for women and children.

IV

THE ORGANIC LAW OF THE STATE of 10th January, 1967

Over the past three decades, the State which came into existence on 18th July, 1936, has performed a gigantic task of reconstruction in every order of national life. Fundamental legislation has kept pace with the major necessities of the country, achieving, thanks to its gradual promulgation, the firm establishment of institutions, while at the same time preserving them from confusing rectifications, which would have been the inevitable consequence of premature decisions. The laws so far promulgated cover the greater part of the questions dictated by an institutional system of administration. The Law on the Principles of the Movement provide the directives governing Spanish policy and serve as a permanent guide and an- unalterable code for all legislative and governmental action. The Fuero de los Esparioles (Statute Law of the Spanish People) and the Labour Law define the duties and rights of Spaniards and protect the exercise of such duties and rights. The Law of Referendum submits to the .consideration and direct decision of the people, the draft laws which circumstances or public interest demand. The Law of the Cortes establishes the composition and prerogatives of the highest organ for the participation of the Spanish people in the affairs of the State. And the Law of Succession contains the declaration that Spain is a political unit, constituted as a Kingdom, and creates the Council of the Realm, which

39

must assist the Head of State in all matters and resolutions coming under his exclusive competence. Nevertheless, the juridical vitality and the political vigour of the Regime, its ability to cope with present problems and the prospects offered by the extended period of its existence, permit and advocate the expansion and improvement of a fundamental legislation. The time has come to close the chapter on the institutionalization of the national State; to delimit the ordinary attributes of the supreme magistrature of the State upon the fulfilment of the provisions of the Law of Succession; to determine the composition of the Government, the procedure for the nomination and retirement of its members, its responsibility and what it regards as improper; to establish the organization and functions of the National Council; to give a fundamental character to the structure of the Judicature, the Armed Forces and Public Administration; to regulate the relations between the Headship of State, the Cortes, the Government and the Council of the Realm; to determine the manner of designation, the term of office and the retirement of the Speaker of the Cortes and the Presiding Officers of the highest Tribunals and consultative bodies; and to open a juridical channel for the impugnment of any legislative or governmental act that may be detrimental to the system of Fundamental Laws. These are the ends of the present Law, which will perfect and place the institutions of the Regime in a harmonious system, and ensure in an effective manner for the future the fidelity of the highest organs of the State to the Principles of the .National Movement. IN VIRTUE WHEREOF, and in the exercise of the legislative faculty conferred on me by the Laws of 30th January, 1938, and 8th August, 1939, pursuant to the agreement of the Spanish Cortes adopted in plenary session. of 22nd November, 1966, and with the legal and direct expression of the Spanish people, manifested by the approval of

40

85.50 per cent of the electorate, which represent 95.86 per cent of voters, in the national Referendum held on 14th December, 1966, I RESOLVE:

V

CONSTITUTIVE LAW OF THE CORTES of 17th July, 1942, amended by the Organic Law of the State of. 10th January, 1967

The creation of a juridical system, the organization of the administrative activities of the. State, the adjustment of the new order to an institutional system with clarity and precision, require a process of elaboration from which it is unwise to omit representatives of the constitutive elements of the national community, in order to achieve a design of the highest quality and a firm foundation in the country. The contrast of opinions â within the unity of the system â the airing of aspirations, well-grounded and constructive criticism, and the intervention of legislative technique should contribute to vitality, justice and the perfection of the positive ,law of the Revolution and of the new Economy of the Spanish people. Hazards so abnormal that it would be idle to explain them have delayed the achievement of this goal. But, the phase of the National Movement when it was not feasible to attempt to put it into effect having passed, the time has come to establish an organ to accomplish this grand design. -Continuing in the Headship of State the supreme power for dictating juridical norms of a general nature, in the terms of the Laws of 30th January, 1938, and 8th August, 1939, the organ created will signify, as well as being an effective instrument of collaboration in that function, a principle of self-limitation for a more systematic institution of authority. On the lines of the National Movement, the Cortes, now in the process of formation, will signify the revival of a 77

glorious Spanish tradition, both in its designation and in its composition and attributions. The amendments introduced by the Organic Law of the State and by its additional dispositions serve to perfect and accentuate the representative character of the political system, which is the basic principle of the public institutions. So far as the Cortes is concerned, they have certain fundamental aims: introducing a new group of Deputies to represent the family, elected by the Heads of Families and married women, in keeping with the principle of equal political rights for women; extending representation to other Societies, Corporations and Associations, at the same time, reducing drastically the number of Deputies therein and, in general, securing a more authentic representation and increasing to a considerable degree the proportion of elected Deputies in relation to those who hold that title by reason of office. The same method is followed in the election, by the Cortes in plenary session and in each legislative term, of the two Vice-Presidents and the four Secretaries. IN VIRTUE OF WHICH, I RESOLVE: Article One The Cortes are the highest organ of participation by the Spanish people in the affairs of the State. The principal function of the Cortes is the elaboration and approval of Laws, without prejudice to the sanction reposing in the Head of State 134 "4
Some precepts of the Organic Law of the State refer to the relations

of the Head of State with the Cortes: Art. 7, on convocation and prorogue; Art. 9 on agreement or authorization to carry out specific acts; Art. 10, stipulating that the Head of State shall be assisted by the Council of the Realm to propose to the Cortes the acts set forth in the preceding article, to return to the Cortes a law drawn up by the Cortes,

Article Two 135 I. The Cortes are composed of Deputies in the following categories:
or to prorogue a legislative term for grave reasons. Similarly, it requires that the Cortes should take note of the measures adopted in the eventualities indicated in Article 10, a) and Article 11 of the Organic Law of the State. The attributions of the Cortes in relation to other high organs of the State are listed in Articles 49-53 and 55. Art. 41 of the Organic Law of the State is a restatement of Art. 26 of the Law on Juridical Procedure of the Administration of th State, of 26th July, 1957, which prohibits the Administration from regulating, save with the express authorization of the Law, matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Cortes. The intervention of the Cortes in the appeal of contrafuero is described in Arts. 59-63 of the Organic Law of the State. The Cortes have been converted into the single legislative organ of the nation, this body having been assigned the task of "elaborating and approving the laws". Formerly, the Cortes only "prepared and elaborated" the laws. The representation of the Trade Union Organization in the Cortes is regulated by Decree of 24th February, 1961, amended by Decrees of 7th March and 23rd April, 1964. On the replacement of Deputies of the Cortes representing the Municipalities, see Decrees of 18th February, 1955, and 22nd February, 1964. For information on Deputies of the Cortes representing the Provincial Deputations and Insular Districts, see Decrees of 4th March, 1955, and 21st April, 1964. The changes made in the composition of the Cortes are substantial: 1. Municipal representation may be effected through any of their Councillors, while the former system limited it to Mayors appointed by the Government. 2. Direct family representation has been introduced, formerly non-existent, through the election of 104 Deputies (two to a province) by the heads of families and married women. See Law on Family Representation in the Cortes, of 26th June, 1967. 3. 4. The number of Deputies freely appointed by the Head of State has A declaration has been made that all Deputies have freedom of been reduced from 50 to 25. action in the service of the nation and the common good, and are not bound by any imperative mandate.

LAW OF SUCCESSION IN THE HEADSHIP OF STATE of 26th July, 1947, amended by the Organic Law of the State of 10th January, 1967

WHEREAS the Spanish Cortes, as the highest organ of participation by the people in the affairs of State, have drawn up the Fundamental Law declaring the constitution of the Kingdom, have created the Council of the Realm and determined the norms governing the Succession in the Headship of State, whose text, having been submitted to the referendum of the nation, has been accepted by eighty-two per cent of the electorate, representing ninetythree per cent of voters. AND WHEREAS the Organic Law of the State amends certain articles of said Fundamental Law, in respect of the ccmposition of the Council of the Realm, determining that ten of its Members shall be elected as against the former number of four; and introduces other amendments to clarify certain points of the process of succession the purpose of avoiding any risks. Pursuant to the approval of the Cortes and with the true and direct expression of the will of the nation, I RESOLVE:

Should the proposal not be accepted, the Government and the Council of the Realm may formulate, subject to the same procedure, a second proposal in favour of another person of royal blood who also is qualified under the law. II. When, in the opinion of the joint session, there is no one of royal blood with the required qualities, or if their proposals have not been accepted by the Cortes, they shall propose, with the same conditions, as Regent, the person who by his prestige, capacity and possible service to the nation, should hold this position. On presenting this proposal, they may indicate the term and conditions for the duration of the Regency, and the Cortes must decide on each of these points.

Their derogation or amendment shall require, not only the approval of the Cortes, but the referendum of the nation.

731 Articles 10 and 75 of the Organic Law of, the State. 97

Article Eleven
I. Once the Crown has been restored to the King, the regular order of succession shall be that of primogeniture and right of succession, with preference for the anterior line over the posterior; in the same line, the closest degree of kinship over the furthest; in the same degree of kinship, the male over the female, who may not reign, but who may transmit the right to her heirs, and, in the same sex, the older over the younger; all this without prejudice to the exceptions and requirements prescribed in the preceding Articles. II. In the event that the heir to the Crown, according to the order established in the preceding paragraph, has not reached the age of thirty when the throne becomes vacant, his public functions shall be exercised by a Regent appointed in accordance with Article Eight of this Law, until the heir reaches the legal age.

IV. In the eventualities discussed in the two preceding paragraphs, the Regency shall come to an end as soon as the reason motivating its presence ceases to exist.

Article Twelve
Ail cession of rights before acceding to the throne, abdications when the successor has been appointed, renouncements of any nature and royal marriages, as well as the marriage of the immediate successors, shall be announced by the Council of the Realm and approved by the Cortes of the nation.

98

Article Thirteen The Head of State, upon the advice of the Council of the Realm, may propose to the Cortes that there be excluded from the succession those royal persons lacking the necessary capacity to rule or who, because of their notorious departure from the fundamental principles of the State or because of their acts, deserve to lose the rights of succession established in this Law. Article Fourteen 152 The incapacity of the Head of State, recognized by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Government, shall be communicated in a detailed report to the Council of the Realm. If this Council, by the same majority, should agree on this point, the President of the Council of the Realm shall submit the matter to the Cortes, which, at a session called within the following eight days, shall adopt the ensuing resolution. Article Fifteen I. The validity of the resolutions taken by the Cortes in respect of this Law shall depend on the favourable vote of two-thirds of the Deputies present, which must be equivalent, at least, to the absolute majority of all the Deputies. II. However, in the eventualities discussed in Articles six and eight of the present Law, if the Iwo-thirds majority is not obtained in the first voting, a second and, if necessary, a third vote shall be taken. In the third voting, the resolution shall be validated by a three-fifths majority, which must be equivalent, at least, to the absolute majority.

Article Three
The Government is authorized to issue the complementary dispositions for the taking of the census and the execution of the present Law.

104

Every Spaniard having been given the opportunity to collaborate in the affairs of the State through the natural agencies of the family, the municipality and the Trade Union, and the basic Laws having been promulgated for bringing new vigour and greater spontaneity to the representative bodies within a system of Christian association, in order to safeguard the nation against the deviation that the political history of peoples has shown, to the effect that in matters of the utmost importance or public interest, the will of the nation could be supplanted by the subjective criterion of its rulers, this Headship of State, making use of the faculties granted by the Laws of 30th January, 1948, and 8th August, 1939, has considered it advisable to institute the direct consultation of the nation by public referendum in all those cases in which, because of the transcendent nature of the laws or the uncertainty of opinion, the Head of State should deem such a consultation appropriate.

IN VIRTUE OF WHICH, I RESOLVE: Article One
When the importance of certain laws warrant it, or if public interest demands it, the Head of State may, for the better service of the nation, submit to referendum the Bills (draft laws) drawn up by the Cortes.
