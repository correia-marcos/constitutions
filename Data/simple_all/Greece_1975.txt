NOTE
The Government of national unity formed after the collapse of the military dictatorship under the presidence of Mr. Constantine Caramanlis, had announced, by its first constitutional act dated the 1st of August, 1974, the elaboration of a new Constitution. Another constitutional act dated the 3rd of October, 1974, provided for the proclamation of a referendum in order to fix the type of the democratic regime as well as for the election of an Assembly having as its primary mission the revision of the previous Constitution. The Government issued of the elections of the 17th November, 1974, proclamed, for the 8th of December 1974, a referendum in which the resaults had attested the preference of the electorate for a republican regime. One month later the same Government submitted to the Parliament a draft project of the Constitution giving an answer to the directive lines indicated by article 3 of the Constitutional Act of the 3rd of October, 1974 which would serve as a basis for the future projects. A special Parliamentary Commission has been formed which, after an examination of the dispositions of the governmental draft project, was divided into two sub-committees, which, after 25 meetings, prepared a project to be submitted to the Parliament. The discussion before the Parliament lasted for more than two*months. After 31 meetings the Parliament, in full session, approved, on the 9th of June 1975, the new Constitution fixing the 11th of June 1975 as the date of its entering into force. The new Constitution is a resault of synthesis. Although it adopts, in part, the provisions of the Constitution of 1952,"it follows the line of most liberal constitutions, based on the ideologic plurality and on the human values. In addition to the provisions contained in the governmental draft project, many of which, have been incorporated in the final text, more or less modified and amended, no one could have an exact idea of the inspiration and the sources of the new provisions without having recource to

propositions and amendments added by the opposition and by all the members of Parliament, taken individually, irrespective of the party they belong to. If one wishes to establish in a concrete manner the results of all these contributions as to the spirit and to the content of the new Constitution, one may affirm soundly that, with its form and with its new provisions, the new Constitution tends of to the following : a) To enlarge and to strengthen the system of individual liberty, regulating at the same time certain points which, in the past, caused difficulties and clashes; b ) To realize and to encourage the ideal of social justice. The traditional constitutional provisions are now amended or completed in order to secure both the desired social solidarity and the exercise of the individual rights not only as a subjective privilege but also as a social function; c) Finally to favour t h e reform of the state organization so as to render it less complicated and more efficient in every sector.
