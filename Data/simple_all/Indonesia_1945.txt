PREAMBLE Since independence is the right of every nation, any subjugation in this world is contrary to humanity and justice, and must therefore be abolished. Our struggle for an independent Indonesia has come to a successful stage and the Indonesian people are on the very threshold of an Indonesia State â€” free, united, sovereign, just and prosperous. With the blessing of God Almighty and moved by the high ideal of a free national life, the Indonesian people hereby declare their Independence. The establishment of a national Indonesian Government is for nurturing the Indonesian people and their territories; for promoting public welfare; for uplifting the standard of living, and for participation in the founding of a world order, based on independence, eternal peace and social justice. Therefore, our national Independence is embodied in the Constitution of the Indonesian State, established as a republic with sovereignty vested in the people.
