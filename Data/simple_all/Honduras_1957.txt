Honduras is a sovereign and independent State, erected as a democratic Republic, to ensure the enjoyment of freedom, justice, social and economic well-being, and the individual and collective betterment of its inhabitants. Art. 2. Sovereignty resides in the people, who may exercise it directly or through the public power created by their freely expressed will. Art. 3. The government, through the democratic, republican, and representative system, is exercised by three complementary and independent powers: Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. Art. 4. No immediate reelection (alternabilidad) in the exercise of the Presidency of the Republic is compulsory. Violation of this rule gives the right to popular insurrection. Art. 5. The officials are the depositaries of the authority of the State, and in swearing to faithful compliance with the Constitution and the laws, they bind themselves to exercise such authority in the public service. This service function renders a public servant directly liable for action or omission. The right to action to render the liability of officials of the State effective, for punishable acts or omissions, is public and imprescriptible. Any act performed outside the law is null and void. Art. 6. The territory of Honduras is situated between the Atlantic and PaIts cific Oceans and the Republics of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.	 boundaries with the Republic of Guatemala are those established by the arbitration

In the cases referred to in the three preceding paragraphs, the domain of the nation is inalienable and imprescriptible, and concessions may be granted only by the Republic to individuals or civil or commercial companies organized or incorporated under Honduran laws, subject to the condition that regular undertakings be established for exploitation of the elements mentioned and that requirements prescribed by law are met. In the case of petroleum and solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons, a special law shall determine the manner in which exploitation of these and similar products is to be undertaken. 4. As a consequence of the foregoing declarations, the State reserves the right to establish the boundaries of zones for the control and protection of national resources in the continental and insular seas which are under the control of the Government of Honduras and to change such boundaries according to circumstances that may arise by reason of new discoveries, studies and national interests that may occur in the future. 5.

To this end, the Legislative Power is authorized to ratify treaties aimed at accomplishing this partially or in full, provided this is proposed in a fair and democratic manner. Art. 11.
