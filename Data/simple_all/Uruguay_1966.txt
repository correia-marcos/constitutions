Art. 41. The care and education of children, so that they may attain their fullest physical, intellectual, and social capacity, is the duty and the right of parents. Those who have large families to support are entitled to compensatory aid if they need it. The law shall provide the necessary measures for the protection of infancy and youth against physical, intellectual, or moral neglect by their parents or guardians, as well as against exploitation and abuse.

The law shall promote investments to this end, preferably from public savings. Every commercial or industrial organization that is in the form of a trust shall be under the control of the State. Art. 51. The establishment and enforcement of rates for public services operated by firms holding concessions shall be conditional upon their approval by the State or departmental governments, as the case may be. The concessions to which this article refers may in no case be granted in perpetuity. Art. 52. Usury is prohibited. The law fixing a maximum limit on interest rates on loans is of a public character. This law will fix the penalties to be applied to offenders thereunder. No one may be deprived of his liberty for debts. Art. 53. Labor is under the legal protection of the law. It is the duty of every inhabitant of the Republic, without prejudice to his freedom, to apply his intellectual or physical energies in a manner which will redound to the benefit of the community, which will endeavor to afford him, with preference to citizens, the possibility of earning his livelihood through the development of some economic activity. Art. 54. The law must recognize the right of every person, performing labor or services as a worker or employee, to independence of moral and civic consciousness; just remuneration; limitation of the working day; a weekly day of rest; and physical and moral health. The labor of women and of minors under eighteen years of age shall be specially regulated and limited. Art. 55. The law shall regulate the impartial and equitable distribution of labor. Art. 56.

Art. 57. The law shall promote the organization of trade unions, according them charters and issuing regulations for their recognition as juridical persons. It shall likewise promote the creation of tribunals of conciliation and arbitration. The strike is declared to be a right of trade unions. Regulations shall be made governing its exercise and effect, on that basis. Art. 58. Public officials are in the service of the Nation and not of a political party. Any activity alien to their duties is prohibited and political propaganda (proselitismo) on their part at their offices or during office hours, shall be considered unlawful. They may not organize groups for propaganda purposes by using the names of public agencies or any connection their positions may bear to membership in such organizations. Art. 59. The law shall establish civil service regulations (Estatuto del Funcionario) on the fundamental basis that the official exists for the office and not the office for the official. Its principles shall apply to subordinate officials: (A) of the Executive Power, with the exception of the military, police and diplomatic officials, who shall be governed by special laws;

(B) of the Judicial Power and of the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal except with respect to judgeships; (C) of the Tribunal of Accounts; (D) of the Electoral Court and its agencies, without prejudice to regulations enacted for the control of political parties; (E) of the decentralized services, without prejudice to whatever may be provided in special laws covering the diverse nature of their functions. Art. 60. The law shall create a civil service for the central administration, the autonomous entities, and the decentralized services, which shall have the duties established therein to ensure an efficient administration. An administrative career service is established for officials covered by the budget of the central administration, who are declared to have permanent status, without prejudice to provisions of law that may be enacted on the subject by an absolute majority of the votes of the full membership of each Chamber or under the fourth paragraph of this article. They may be dismissed only in accordance with rules established by this Constitution. Officials who are political in character or who have duties of personal trust are not included if given such character by a law approved by an absolute majority of votes of the full membership of each chamber, and they shall be appointed and are subject to dismissal by the appropriate administrative organ. Art. 61. The civil service regulations shall establish the conditions for admission for career officials and shall regulate the right to permanent status, advancement, weekly days of rest, and the system of annual and sick leave; grounds for suspension or transfer; their official duties; and administrative resources against rulings that may affect them, without prejudice to the provisions of Section XVII. Art. 62. The departmental governments shall adopt the regulations for their officials in accordance with the rules set forth in the preceding articles, and until this is done the provisions established by law governing public officials shall apply. To grant permanent status to their officials and to establish positions that are political or of personal trust shall require the approval of three fifths of the membership of a Departmental Board (Junta Departamental). Art. 63. Within one year following the promulgation of this Constitution, the commercial and industrial autonomous entities shall prepare civil service regulations for their officials, such regulations to be subject to the approval of the Executive Power. These regulations shall contain provisions designed to ensure normal operation of the services and the guarantees established in the preceding articles for public officials, insofar as they can be reconciled with the specific purposes of each autonomous entity. Art. 64. By a two-thirds vote of the total membership of each chamber,

the law may establish special regulations which, by their general scope or nature, may be applicable to the officials of all departmental governments and all autonomous entities, or only to certain ones, as the case may be. Art. 65. The law may authorize the organization of representative personnel committees within the autonomous entities, for purposes of collaboration with their directors in the enforcement of the regulations, study of budgetary requirements, organization of the services, labor regulations and the application of disciplinary measures. In public services administered directly or by concession holders, the law may provide for the formation of competent organs to hear disputes between authorities of the services and their employees; and to consider methods and procedures to be used by the public authority to maintain continuity of service. Art. 66. No parliamentary or administrative investigation of irregularities, neglect, or malfeasance shall be considered as completed until the accused official has had an opportunity to submit his answer and to present his defence. Art. 67. The general retirement and social security funds shall be organized in such a way as to guarantee to all workers, employers, employees, and laborers adequate retirement pensions and subsidies in case of accident, sickness, disability, enforced unemployment, etc.; and in case of death, the corresponding pension to their families. The old age pension is the right of those who have reached the limit of their productive age, after long residence in the country, and who lack the means to provide for the necessities of life. Art. 68. Freedom of education is guaranteed. The law shall regulate state intervention for the sole purpose of maintaining hygiene, morality, safety and public order. Every parent or guardian has the right to select the teachers or institutions he desires for the education of his children or wards. Art. 69. Private educational institutions and cultural institutions of the same kind shall be exempt from national and municipal taxes as a subsidy for their services. Art. 70. Primary education and intermediate, agrarian, or industrial education are compulsory. The State shall promote the development of scientific research and of technical education. Appropriate legislation shall be enacted to enforce these provisions. Art. 71. Free official primary, intermediate, advanced, industrial, artistic, and physical education is declared to be of social utility, as well as the creation of scholarships for continued study and specialization in cultural, scientific and occupational fields, and the establishment of public libraries.


In all educational institutions special attention shall be paid to the formation of the moral and civic character of students.
CHAPTER III

Art. 72. The enumeration of rights, duties, and guarantees made in this Constitution does not exclude others which are inherent in human beings or which are derived from a republican form of government.

SECTION III CITIZENSHIP AND SUFFRAGE
CHAPTER I

Art. 73. Citizens of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay are natural or legal. Art. 74. All men and women born at any place within the territory of the Republic are natural citizens. Children of Uruguayan fathers or mothers are also natural citizens, wherever they may have been born, provided that they take up residence in the country and register themselves in the Civil Register. Art. 75. The following have the right to legal citizenship: (A) Foreign men and women of good conduct, and having a family within the Republic, who possess some capital or property in the country, or are engaged in some profession, craft, or industry, and have resided habitually in the Republic for three years; (B) Foreign men and women of good conduct, without families in the Republic, who possess any of the qualifications mentioned in the preceding paragraph and who have resided habitually in the country for five years; (C) Foreign men and women who obtain special courtesy from the General Assembly for noteworthy services or outstanding merit. Proof of residence must necessarily be based on a public or private document of proven date. The rights appertaining to legal citizenship may not be exercised by foreigners included in paragraph (A) and (B) until three years after the issuance of the respective citizenship papers. The existence of any of the grounds for suspension referred to in Article 80 shall bar the granting of citizenship papers. Art. 76. Any citizen may hold public employment. Legal citizens may not be appointed until three years after obtaining citizenship papers. Citizenship shall not be required for a position as professor in institutions of higher learning.

CHAPTER II

Art. 77. Every citizen is a member of the sovereignty of the Nation; as such he is a voter and eligible for election in the cases and in accordance with the procedure which will be set forth. Suffrage shall be exercised in the manner determined by law, but on the following bases: (1) Compulsory inscription in the Civil Register; (2) Secret and compulsory vote. The law, by an absolute majority of the full membership of each Chamber, shall regulate the fulfilment of this obligation. (3) Integral proportional representation. (4) Judicial magistrates, members of the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal and the Tribunal of Accounts, directors of the autonomous entities and the decentralized services, persons in active military service regardless of rank, and police officials of whatever category, must abstain, under penalty of dismissal and withdrawal of eligibility to hold any other public office for from two to ten years, from membership in political committes or clubs, from signing party proclamations, and from authorizing the use of their names and, in general, from any other public or private act of a political character, with the exception of voting. The participation of directors of the autonomous entities and the decentralized services in party organizations engaged in the specific task of the study of government, legislation, and administration, is not regarded as included in these prohibitions. The Electoral Court shall be competent to take cognizance of and impose penalties for the above-mentioned electoral offenses. The accusation should be made before the Electoral Court through the intermediary of the national party authorities. Without prejudice to the above provisions, the facts shall in all cases be referred to the ordinary courts for such additional action as they may deem appropriate. (5) The President of the Republic and members of the Electoral Court may not belong to political committees or clubs, nor hold directive positions in party organizations, nor take part in any way in political election propaganda; (6) All electoral boards which may be designated to intervene in questions of suffrage must be elected with the guarantees provided in this article. (7) Any new law concerning the Civil Register or elections, as well as any amendment or interpretation of the existing laws, shall require a two-thirds vote of the full membership of each Chamber. This special majority shall apply only to the guarantees of suffrage and election, composition, functions, and procedure of the Electoral Court and electoral boards. For

action in matters of expenditures, budgets, and internal regulations, a simple majority will be sufficient. (8) By a two-thirds vote of the full membership of each chamber, the law may extend the prohibitions contained in items (4) and (5) to include other officials. (9) The election of members of both chambers of the Legislative Power, of the President and Vice-President of the Republic, of the members of the departmental boards, of the intendentes, and where pertinent, of the elective autonomous local boards, and of any organ for which the law may provide that its organization or composition shall be determined by popular election, shall take place on the last Sunday in November every five years, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 148. The lists of candidates for both chambers and for President and VicePresident of the Republic shall be included on a single ballot. A separate ballot, bearing the same party label, shall contain the lists of candidates, to be voted on jointly, for the departmental boards, intendentes, and where pertinent, the elective autonomous local boards, in accordance with the provisions of Article 79. (10) No legislator or intendente who resigns his post after assuming office shall have the right to collect any compensation or retirement benefit which might pertain to him by reason of his termination, until the full term for which he was elected has expired. This provision does not include resignations because of illness duly substantiated by a medical board, nor those expressly authorized by three fifths of the votes of the full membership of the body concerned, nor to intendentes who resign three months before an election in order to become a candidate. Art. 78. Foreign men and women of good conduct, having a family in the Republic, who possess some capital or property within the country or are engaged in some profession, craft, or industry and have habitually resided at least fifteen years in the Republic have the right to vote without the necessity of previously obtaining legal citizenship. Proof of residence must be based on a public or private document of proven date, and if the evidence is satisfactory to the authority competent to pass upon it, the foreigner will be entitled to exercise the right to vote from the time he is inscribed in the Civil Register, as authorized by a certificate issued by the same authority for this purpose.
CHAPTER III

Art. 79. Votes cast under party labels for any elective office may be "accumulated" only if such party labels are permanent, without prejudice to compliance in all cases, for the election of representatives, with the provisions of Article 88. To be considered permanent, a party must have participated in the preceding national election and must have obtained

parliamentary representation. The law, by a two-thirds vote of the full membership of each chamber, may modify this requirement. Twenty-five percent of all persons registered and qualified to vote may, within one year following their promulgation, demand a referendum against laws and exercise the right of initiative before the Legislative Power. These institutions are not applicable with respect to laws imposing taxes. They are likewise inapplicable in those cases in which the initiative is an exclusive right of the Executive Power. Both institutions shall be regulated by law, enacted by an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber.
CHAPTER IV

Art. 80. Citizenship is suspended: (1) By physical or mental ineptitude which prevents free and reflective action; (2) By being under indictment on a criminal charge which may result in a penitentiary sentence; (3) By being under eighteen years of age; (4) By being under sentence which imposes the penalty of exile, prison, penitentiary, or loss of political rights during the term of the sentence; (5) By habitually engaging in morally dishonest activities which shall be specified by law in accordance with item 7 of Article 77; (6) By being a member of social or political organizations which advocate the destruction of the fundamental bases of the nation by violence or propaganda inciting to violence. Those mentioned in Sections I and II of this Constitution are considered to be such for the purposes of this provision; (7) By a continuing lack of good conduct as required by Article 75. The last two grounds shall apply only with respect to legal citizens. Exercise of the right granted by Article 78 is suspended on the grounds listed above.
CHAPTER V

Art. 81. Nationality is not lost even by naturalization in another country, it being sufficient for the purpose of regaining the rights of citizenship merely to take up residence in the Republic and register in the Civil Register. Legal citizenship is lost by any other form of subsequent naturalization.


SECTION IV THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND ITS VARIOUS POWERS
CHAPTER I

Art. 82. The nation adopts the democratic-republican form of government.

Art. 87. An affirmative vote of the absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber shall be necessary to authorize taxes.

Representatives shall hold office for five years and their election shall be effected under the guaranties and rules of suffrage provided in Section III. Art. 90. To be a Representative it is necessary to be a natural citizen in full exercise of civil rights, or a legal citizen who has exercised his civil rights for five years, and in both cases, to have attained twenty-five years of age. Art. 91. The following may not be Representatives: (1) The President and Vice-President of the Republic, members of the Judicial Power, the Tribunal of Accounts, the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, the Electoral Court, of the councils or boards of directors, or directors of the autonomous entities and of the decentralized services, of the departmental boards, the local boards, and intendentes; (2) Military employees or civil employees of the Executive, Legislative or Judicial Powers, the Electoral Court, Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, Tribunal of Accounts, the departmental governments, the autonomous entities and the decentralized services, if they receive a salary, but excepting retired or pensioned employees.

Military persons who resign their posts and salary in order to serve in the Legislature shall retain their rank, but for the duration of their legislative functions they may not be promoted; they shall be exempt from all military discipline and the time during which they hold their legislative position shall not be counted for purposes of seniority for promotion. Art. 92. The President of the Republic, the Vice-President of the Republic, and any citizens who may have replaced the President, if they held office for more than one year, continuous or discontinuous may not be candidates for Representative. Likewise, judges and prosecuting attorneys, intendentes, police officials in the department where they perform their duties, military officers in the districts in which they command forces or actively perform any other military function, may not be candidates unless they resign and terminate their positions three months prior to the election.

CHAPTER III

Art. 94. The Senate shall be composed of thirty members, elected directly by the people, in a single electoral district, pursuant to the guaranties and rules concerning suffrage contained in Section III and as stated in subsequent articles. It shall also include the Vice-President of the Republic, who shall have a voice and vote, and shall serve as the presiding officer of the Senate as well as of the General Assembly. Whenever he permanently or temporarily assumes the Presidency of the Republic, or in the event of a permanent or temporary vacancy in the vice-presidency, the presidency of the Senate shall be occupied by the person heading the list which received the most votes within the party receiving the most votes and, if the same circumstances recur, the next person on the same list.

To be a Senator it is necessary to be a natural citizen in full exercise of civil rights, or a legal citizen who has exercised these rights for seven years, and in both cases to have attained thirty years of age.

SECTION VI SESSIONS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PROVISIONS COMMON TO BOTH CHAMBERS. THE PERMANENT COMMISSION
CHAPTER I

Art. 104. The General Assembly shall begin its sessions on the fifteenth of March each year, meeting until the fifteenth of December, or only until October fifteenth, in the event that there are elections, and the new Assembly must in that event begin its sessions on the fifteenth of the following February. The General Assembly shall meet on the dates indicated, without the necessity of special convocation by the Executive Power, and until the Vice-President assumes office its sessions and those of the Senate shall be

presided over by the person who received the most votes in the list of Senators of the party receiving the most votes. Only for grave and urgent reasons may the General Assembly or either of its chambers, or the Executive Power, convoke extraordinary sessions to terminate a recess, and then exclusively for the purpose of dealing with the questions which have given rise to the convocation or with a proposed law declared to be of urgent consideration and that is under study although it was not included in the call. Likewise, a recess is automatically suspended for the chamber which has before it or which receives for consideration, during the recess, a proposal declared to be of urgent consideration. A simple convocation to extraordinary sessions does not suffice to terminate the recess of the General Assembly or of either of its chambers. For the recess to be interrupted sessions must actually be held, and the interruption shall last as long as the sessions are being held.
CHAPTER II

Art. 105. Each chamber shall be governed internally by such regulations as it may issue, and when they meet jointly in General Assembly, by such rules as the General Assembly may make. Art. 106. Each chamber shall appoint its President and Vice-Presidents, with the exception of the President of the Senate, whose appointment is governed by the provisions of Article 94. Art. 107. Each chamber shall appoint its secretaries and personnel, in conformity with regulations which must be established in accordance with the guaranties provided in Articles 58 to 66, wherever appropriate. Art. 108. Within the first twelve months of each legislative term, each chamber shall adopt its budget by a vote of three fifths of its full membership, and shall notify the Executive Power in order that they may be included in the national budget. Within the first five months of each legislative term, any changes deemed indispensable may be adopted by the same quorum. If the budget has not been approved before these periods have expired, the previous budget shall continue in force. Art. 109. Neither chamber may open its sessions unless more than half of its members are present, and if such is not the case on the day designated by the Constitution, the minority may meet for the purpose of compelling absent members to attend under penalties which they may prescribe. Art. 110. The chambers shall communicate in writing between themselves and with the other public powers through their respective Presidents and with the authorization of a secretary. Art. 111. The granting of special pensions shall be decided by secret


vote and require approval by an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber. The regulations of each chamber may provide for a secret vote in cases of pardons and appointments.
CHAPTER III

Art. 112. Senators and Representatives shall never be held liable for the votes they cast or opinions expressed during the discharge of their duties. Art. 113. No Senator or Representative, from the day of his election until that of his termination, may be arrested except in case of flagrante delicto and then notice shall immediately be given to the respective chamber, with a summary report of the case. Art. 114. No Senator or Representative, from the day of his election until that of his termination, may be indicted on a criminal charge, or even for common offenses which are not specified in Article 93, except before his own chamber, which, by two thirds of the votes of its full membership, shall decide whether or not there are grounds for prosecution, and if so, shall declare him suspended from office, and he shall be placed at the disposition of a competent tribunal. Art. 115. Each chamber may reprimand any of its members for disorderly conduct in the discharge of his duties, and may even suspend him by a two-thirds vote of its full membership. By the same number of votes it may remove a member for physical or mental incapacity which developed after he took office, or for conduct rendering him unworthy of his office after he was declared elected. A simple majority of those present shall be sufficient to accept voluntary resignations. Art. 116. Vacancies which may occur for any reason during each legislative term, shall be filled by the alternates designated at the time of the elections, in the manner to be provided by law, and without a new election. The law may also authorize the substitution of alternates in cases of temporary disability or absence of the principals. Art. 117. Senators and Representatives shall be compensated for their services by a monthly salary which they shall receive during their term of office, without prejudice to pertinent deductions, pursuant to the regulations of the chamber concerned, in case of unjustifiable absence from the chamber to which they belong or from committees of which they are members. Such deductions shall in each case be made in proportion to the salary. The salary shall be fixed by a two-thirds vote of the full membership of the General Assembly, meeting in joint session, during the last period


of each legislative term, for the members of the succeeding term. This compensation shall be paid with absolute independence from the Executive Power and other than this, legislators may not receive economic benefits of any kind deriving from the office they hold.
CHAPTER IV

Art. 118. Any legislator may ask a Minister of State, the Supreme Court of Justice, the Electoral Court, the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, and the Tribunal of Accounts, for such data and information as he may consider necessary for the discharge of his duties. The request shall be made in writing and through the intermediary of the President of the respective chamber, who will transmit it immediately to the appropriate agency. If the latter does not supply the information within the period to be fixed by law, the legislator may request it through the chamber to which he belongs, which will make a final decision in the case. Matters pertaining to the jurisdictional business and competence of the Judicial Power and of the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal may not be the object of such a request. Art. 119. Each chamber has the right, by a resolution of one third of its full membership, to require the presence on its floor of the Ministers of State in order to question them and receive from them information which it considers appropriate, whether for legislative purposes or for purposes of inspection or investigation, without prejudice to the provisions of Section VIII. When such information refers to autonomous entities or decentralized services, the Ministers may require the simultaneous attendance of a representative of the corresponding council or board of directors. Art. 120. Each chamber may appoint parliamentary committees for making investigations or for obtaining data for legislative purposes. Art. 121. In the cases contemplated in the three preceding articles, either chamber may make statements, without prejudice to the provisions of Section VIII.
CHAPTER V

Art. 122. Senators and Representatives, after they have taken their seats in their respective chambers, may not hold salaried positions under the State, the departmental governments, the autonomous entities, the decentralized services, or any other public agency, or perform remunerative services of any kind for them, without the consent of the chamber to which they belong, and in all such cases their seats shall be considered vacated by the act of accepting such a position or rendering such service. Whenever a Senator is called to serve temporarily as President of the


Republic and whenever Senators and Representatives are called to serve as Ministers or undersecretaries of State, their legislative functions are suspended, and during such suspension their corresponding alternates shall replace them. Art. 123. The legislative function is likewise incompatible with the holding of any other elective public office, regardless of its nature. Art. 124. Senators and Representatives, during their term of office, are likewise prohibited from: (1) Participating as directors, administrators, or employees of enterprises under contract for works or services with the State, the departmental governments, autonomous entities, decentralized services or any other public agency; (2) Carrying or directing matters in behalf of third parties before the central administration, departmental governments, autonomous entities or the decentralized services. Nonobservance of the provisions of this article will entail immediate loss of the legislative office. Art. 125. The prohibition provided in the first paragraph of Article 122 shall apply to Senators and Representatives until one year after the end of their term of office, except by the express authorization of the respective chamber. Art. 126. The law, by an absolute majority of votes of the full membership of each chamber may enact regulations on the prohibitions set forth in the preceding two articles or may establish others or extend them to include persons in other agencies.
CHAPTER VI

Art. 127. There shall be a Permanent Commission composed of four Senators and seven Representatives elected by the proportional system and designated by their respective chambers. The president shall be a Senator of the majority. The designation is to be made annually within fifteen days after the organization of the General Assembly or after the beginning of each period of regular sessions of the legislature. Art. 128. At the same time that this election is held, an alternate is to be elected for each of the eleven members, who shall replace the member in case of his illness, death, or other impediment. Art. 129. The Permanent Commission shall be the guardian of the observance of the Constitution and the laws, and shall make the necessary representations to the Executive Power in this respect, under responsibility to the existing or following General Assembly, as the case may be. Art. 130. In the event the aforementioned representations, if made for the second time, do not produce any effect, the Commission may, according to the importance and gravity of the matter in question, convoke the General Assembly on its own responsibility. In the event that the President of the Republic has made use of the power granted him by Article 148, paragraph 7, the Permanent Commission shall report to the General Assembly when the new chambers are organized, or when the previous ones renew their functions. Art. 131. It shall exercise its functions while the General Assembly is in recess and until its regular sessions are resumed. Matters within the competence of the Permanent Commission that are under study by the General Assembly or by the Senate on the date set for beginning a recess shall ipso facto be referred to the Commission. Nevertheless, if the recess is interrupted, and during special sessions that have been decreed, the General Assembly or the Senate may, when it so decides, assume jurisdiction in matters within its competence which are under consideration by the Permanent Commission, upon notice to the latter body. When the special sessions are ended, matters left undecided over which the General Assembly or Senate had assumed jurisdiction shall be referred directly to the Permanent Commission by the appropriate officials. During each special session that takes place during a recess, the General Assembly or Senate may make use of the power granted it by this article. When the recess is ended, matters before the Permanent Commission that have not been decided shall be referred directly to the appropriate body. The obligation and the responsibility imposed on the Permanent Commission by Article 129 shall not be affected by the circumstance that the General Assembly or either Chamber meets in special session, even if the General Assembly or Senate has assumed jurisdiction over all matters under consideration by the Permanent Commission. If the powers of the Senators and Representatives have lapsed by reason of the expiration of their constitutional terms, and the newly elected Senators and Representatives have not been proclaimed, or use has been made of the power granted by Article 148, paragraph 4, the Permanent Commission shall continue to exercise the functions conferred upon it by this chapter, until the new chambers are organized. In such case, when each chamber is organized it shall designate new members of the Permanent Commission. Art. 132. The Permanent Commission shall likewise be competent to give or withhold its consent in all cases in which the Executive Power requires it in accordance with the present Constitution, and it shall have the authority conferred on the chambers in Articles 118 et seq., without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 13 of Article 168.

SECTION VII INTRODUCTION, DISCUSSION, PASSAGE AND PROMULGATION OF THE LAWS
CHAPTER I

Art. 133. Any bill may originate in either of the two chambers on the proposal of any of its members or by the Executive Power through the intermediary of its Ministers, without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 6 of Article 85 and Article 86. The initiative of the Executive Power shall be required for any bill specifying tax exemptions or fixing minimum wages or prices for the purchase of the products or goods of public or private enterprise. The Legislative Power may not increase the tax exemptions nor the minimums proposed by the Executive Power for wages and prices, nor may it lower the proposed maximum prices.
CHAPTER II

Art. 134. If the chamber in which a bill originated approves it, it shall be transmitted to the other in order that, after discussion therein, it may be approved, amended, amplified, or rejected. Art. 135. If either of the two chambers to which a bill has been sent returns it with additions or objections and the chamber which sent it agrees to them, it shall give notice to that effect and the bill shall be sent to the Executive Power; but if the latter chamber is not in accord and insists on maintaining the bill in the form in which it was originally submitted, it may in that case request a joint session of both chambers and, according to the result of the discussion, there shall be adopted whatever may be decided by a two-thirds vote, which may modify the divergent bills or even approve a new one. Art. 136. If the chamber to which a bill has been sent has no objection to offer, it shall approve it and by merely notifying the chamber which submitted it, shall submit it to the Executive Power in order that it may be published. Bills which have not passed both chambers in the. same legislature shall be considered as having originated in the chamber which last passed them. Art. 137. If, upon receipt of a bill, the Executive Power has objections or observations to make, the bill shall be returned with them to the General Assembly within the prescribed period of ten days. Art. 138. Whenever a bill shall have been returned by the Executive
Power with objections or observations, the General Assembly shall be convoked and the matter shall be decided by a three-fifths vote of the members present. When sixty days have elapsed since the first call without a decision by the General Assembly, the objections of the Executive Power shall be considered accepted. Art. 139. If the objections of the Executive Power refer to a part of the bill, the Assembly, by an absolute majority of the members present, may pass the bill modifying it in accordance with the objections. Art. 140. If the chambers in joint session disapprove the bill returned by the Executive Power it shall be considered null and void for the time being and may not again be presented until the following legislature. Art. 141. In all cases of the reconsideration of a bill returned by the Executive, the voting shall be by name and by "yes" and "no", and both the names and reasons of those voting, as well as the objections or observations of the Executive Power, shall be immediately published in the press. Art. 142. Whenever a bill passed by one chamber shall be rejected by the other at the beginning, it shall be considered as null and void for the time being and may not again be introduced until the following period of the legislature.
CHAPTER III

Art. 143. If the Executive Power has no objection to offer to a bill which has been submitted to it, it shall immediately give notice to that effect, the bill being thereby approved, and promulgated without delay. Art. 144. If the Executive does not return a bill within the ten days prescribed in Article 137, it shall become law and shall be complied with as such, the chamber which sent it having the right to demand such action if this is not done. Art. 145. When a bill returned by the Executive Power with objections or observations has been considered by the chambers in joint session and has again been approved, it shall be considered as finally passed and shall be communicated to the Executive Power, which shall promulgate it immediately without further objections.
CHAPTER IV

Art. 146. When a law has been passed, the following formula shall invariably be used for its promulgation: "The Senate and the Chamber of Representatives of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, met in General Assembly, decree":


SECTION VIII RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE POWER AND THE EXECUTIVE POWER
CHAPTER I

Art. 147. Either of the chambers may pass judgment on the conduct of Ministers of State by proposing that the General Assembly in joint session shall declare that their acts of administration or of government are censured. Whenever motions to this effect are presented, the chamber in which they are made shall be specially convoked, within a period of not over forty-eight hours, to decide upon its course of action. If the motion is approved by a majority of those present, notice shall be given to the General Assembly, which shall be called within forty-eight hours. If upon the first convocation of the General Assembly there are not a sufficient number of members present to hold a meeting, a second convocation shall be made and the General Assembly shall be considered organized with the number of legislators who attend. Art. 148. The disapproval may be individual, plural, or collective, but in all cases it must be adopted by an absolute majority of the votes of the full membership of the General Assembly, at a special and public session. However, a secret session may be decided upon whenever circumstances so demand. Individual disapproval is one that affects one Minister; plural disapproval one that affects more than one Minister; and collective disapproval is one that affects a majority of the Council of Ministers. Disapproval adopted in accordance with the foregoing articles shall mean the resignation of the Minister, the Ministers, or the Council of Ministers, as the case may be. The President of the Republic may veto the vote of disapproval whenever it has been adopted by less than two thirds of the full membership of the body. In such case the General Assembly shall be convoked into special session to be held within the next ten days. If after the first call the number of legislators in the General Assembly necessary to meet do not attend, a second call shall be made, in not less than twenty-four hours nor more than seventy-two hours after the first call, and if the necessary number again is not present, the act of disapproval shall be considered revoked. If the General Assembly maintains its vote by less than three fifths of



its full membership, the President of the Republic, within the next forty-eight hours, may, by express decision, retain the censured Minister, Ministers, or Council of Ministers, and dissolve the chambers. In such case he must call for a new election of Senators and Representatives which shall be held on the eighth Sunday following the date of the decision referred to. The retaining of the censured Minister, Ministers, or Council of Ministers, the dissolution of the chambers and the call for a new election must be made simultaneously in the same decree. In such case the chambers are suspended, but the rights and privileges of the legislators continue. The President of the Republic may not exercise this power during the last twelve months of his term. During that period the General Assembly may vote a disapproval with the effects indicated in the third paragraph of this article, if it is adopted by two thirds or more of its full membership. In the case of a disapproval that is not collective, the President of the Republic may not exercise this right more than once during his term of office. From the moment the Executive Power does not comply with the decree calling for new elections, the chambers shall resume their sessions ipso jure and recover their constitutional rights as a legitimate power of the State, and the Council of Ministers shall fall. If within ninety days following the election, the Electoral Court has not proclaimed elected a majority of the members of each chamber, the dissolved chambers shall also recover their rights. If a majority of the members of each of the new chambers is proclaimed elected by the Electoral Court, the General Assembly shall meet with all its rights within three days following the respective notification. The new General Assembly shall meet without prior convocation by the Executive Power and the previous one shall terminate at that time. Within fifteen days after its organization, the new General Assembly, by an absolute majority of its full membership, shall maintain or revoke the vote of disapproval. If it is maintained the Council of Ministers shall fall. The chambers elected by special election shall complete the normal term of those who left office. SECTION IX THE EXECUTIVE POWER

Council of Ministers, as established in this section and other concordant provisions. Art. 150.

The President and Vice-President shall hold office for five years, and in order to again hold these offices it shall be necessary that five years have elapsed since the date of leaving office. This provision includes the President in respect of the vice presidency but not the Vice-President in respect of the presidency, except as indicated in subsequent paragraphs. The Vice-President and any citizen who has occupied the presidency during a permanent vacancy of more than one year may not be elected to those offices without a lapse of the same period of time as indicated in the first paragraph. Likewise, the Vice-President or the citizen who occupied the presidency -within the three months preceding an election may not be elected President. Art. 153.

In his default, it shall be held by the first person on the same list and serving as Senator, who meets the qualifications and does not have the indicated impediments, and so on successively. Art. 154. The remuneration of the President of the Republic shall be fixed by law prior to each election and may not be altered during his term of office. Art. 155. In the event of resignation, permanent incapacity, or death of the President and Vice-President elect, before assuming office, the


presidency and vice-presidency shall be held, respectively, by the first and second persons on the list receiving the most votes of the party receiving the most votes for Senators, who meet the qualifications prescribed by Article 151, who do not have the impediments indicated in Article 152, and who are holding office as Senators. In their default the offices go to any other persons on the same list who are serving as Senators and who meet these qualifications and do not have those impediments. Art. 156. If a President and Vice-President of the Republic have not been declared elected by the Electoral Court as of the date they are to take office, or if their election was annulled, the outgoing President shall delegate the office to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, who shall serve until the transmission is effected, during which time his judicial functions are suspended. Art. 157. Whenever the President-elect is temporarily incapacitated from assuming office or from performing his duties, he shall be replaced by the Vice-President, and in default of the latter, in accordance with the procedure established by Article 153, for such time as the causes of the incapacity persist. Art. 158. On the first of March following the election, the President and Vice-President of the Republic shall take office, after first making the following declaration in the presence of both chambers meeting in joint session as General Assembly: "I, N. N., promise on my honor loyally to fulfill the office which has been entrusted to me, and to guard and defend the Constitution of the Republic." Art. 159. The President of the Republic shall represent the State both at home and abroad.
CHAPTER II

Art. 160. The Council of Ministers shall be composed of the heads of the several Ministries or the persons acting in their place, and it shall have exclusive competence over all acts of government and administration submitted to it by the President of the Republic or his Ministers on topics relating to their respective departments. It shall also have exclusive competence in respect of the cases covered by items 7 (declaration of urgency), 16, 19, and 24 of Article 168. Art. 161. It shall be presided over by the President of the Republic, who shall have a voice in the discussions and a vote on resolutions which shall be decisive in case of a tie, even if this had resulted from his own vote. The Council of Ministers shall be convoked by the President of the Republic whenever he deems it desirable or when requested by one or more Ministers to discuss matters of their respective departments; and it must meet within twenty-four hours following the date of the call.

Art. 162. The Council shall hold a meeting if a majority of its members are present, and its decisions shall be adopted by an absolute majority vote of the members present. Art. 163. A discussion may be terminated at any time and by the same majority. A motion to that effect is not debatable. Art. 164. Any decisions of the Council of Ministers may be revoked by the vote of an absolute majority of its members. Art. 165. Decisions which had originally been agreed upon by the President of the Republic and a Minister or Ministers may be revoked by the Council by an absolute majority of those present. Art. 166. The Council of Ministers shall adopt its internal regulations. Art. 167. Whenever a Minister is temporarily in charge of another Ministry, only a single vote is counted in the Council of Ministers.
CHAPTER III

The President of the Republic, acting with the respective Minister or Ministers, or with the Council of Ministers, has the following duties: (1) The preservation of internal order and tranquillity, and external security; (2) The supreme command of all armed forces; (3) To grant retirement and regulate the pensions of civilian and military employees, in accordance with the laws; (4) To publish and circulate without delay all laws which, in accordance with Section VII, are ready to be published and circulated; to enforce them and see that they are enforced, and to issue such special regulations as may be necessary for their execution; (5) To inform the Legislative Power, at the beginning of regular sessions, of the state of the Republic and of the improvements and reforms which he considers worthy of its attention; (6) To set forth objections or make observations concerning bills which the Legislative Power sends him, and to suspend or oppose their promulgation in the manner provided in Section VII; (7) To propose bills to the chambers or amendments to laws previously enacted. Such bills may be submitted with a declaration of urgent consideration. The declaration of urgency must be made simultaneously with the submission of each proposal, in which case they must be considered by the Legislative Power within the periods stated below, and they shall be considered as adopted if within such periods they have not been expressly rejected and no substitute proposal has been adopted. Their adoption shall follow these rules: (a) The Executive Power may not send more than one bill with a decla-

When the first thirty days have elapsed, the chamber shall be called into special and permanent session for consideration of the bill. When the fifteen days of that call have expired and the bill has not been rejected, it shall be regarded as approved by that chamber in the form in which it was submitted by the Executive Power, and it shall be immediately and directly communicated to the other chamber or to the Executive Power, as the case may be; (e) If the second chamber approves a different text from the one submitted by the first, the bill shall be returned to that chamber, which is allowed twenty days for its consideration.

Diplomatic and consular officers may likewise be dismissed with the previous consent of the Senate for the

Art. 174. There shall be eleven Ministries, each of which shall have its own designation, and such powers and authority as may be specified by a law passed by an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber. The President of the Republic, acting in Council of Ministers, may redistribute such powers and authority. Their number may also be modified by law, on the initiative of the Executive Power, each case requiring the affirmative vote of an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber. The President of the Republic shall allot the Ministries to citizens who, by virtue of their parliamentary support, are assured of remaining in office. Ministries shall cease to function by resolution of the President of the Republic, without prejudice to the provisions of Section VIII. Art. 175. A Minister or Ministers shall be responsible for such decrees or orders as they may sign or issue with the President of the Republic, except in case of an express resolution of the Council of Ministers, in which the responsibility rests with those who agreed to the decision, such responsibility becoming effective in accordance with the provisions of Articles 93, 102 and 103. Art. 176. The same qualifications shall be required for a Minister as for a Senator. Ar. 177. Upon the opening of each legislative period, the Ministers shall submit a concise report to the General Assembly, on all matters concerning their respective Ministries. Art. 178. Ministers of State shall be entitled to the same immunities and shall be subject to the same incompatibilities and prohibitions as Senators and Representatives, wherever pertinent. They may not be impeached except in the manner indicated in Article 93 and even then, only while holding office. Whenever an impeachment is

supported by a two-thirds vote of the full membership of the Chamber of Representatives, the impeached Minister is thereby suspended from his duties. Art. 179. Ministers shall not be exempt from responsibility for crime even if they invoke the written or verbal order of the President of the Republic or the Council of Ministers. Art. 180. Ministers may attend the sessions of the General Assembly, of either chamber, of the Permanent Commission, and of their respective standing committees, and may take part in debate but shall have no vote. The undersecretaries of State shall have the same right, if so authorized by the respective Minister, except in the situations covered by Articles 119 and 147, in which case they may attend if accompanied by the Minister. In all cases, the undersecretaries shall act under the responsibility of the Ministers. Art. 181. The powers and duties of the Ministers, in their respective portfolios and in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Executive Power, are as follows: (1) To enforce the Constitution, laws, decrees, and resolutions; (2) To formulate and submit to the consideration of superior authority, such projects of laws, decrees and resolutions as they may deem appropriate; (3) To effect, within the limits of their functions, the payment of recognized debts of the State; (4) To grant leaves of absence to the employees of their departments; (5) To propose the appointment or discharge of employees of their divisions; (6) To supervise administrative functions and adopt the necessary measures for their proper conduct, and to impose disciplinary penalties; (7) To sign and communicate the resolutions of the Executive Power; (8) To perform any other functions entrusted to them by laws or by measures adopted by the Executive Power in Council of Ministers, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 160; (9) To delegate any functions deemed desirable, determined by a reasoned resolution and under their political responsibility.

SECTION XI THE AUTONOMOUS ENTITIES AND DECENTRALIZED SERVICES
CHAPTER I

Art. 185. The various services of the industrial and commercial domain of the State shall be administered by boards of directors or directors general and shall have the degree of decentralization that is determined by this Constitution and by laws enacted with the approval of an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber. Boards of directors, if composed of salaried members, shall consist of five or seven members as the law may establish in each case. The law, by a two-thirds vote of the full membership of each chamber, may prescribe that the decentralized services shall be headed by a director general, appointed according to the procedure indicated in Article 187. In the conclusion of agreements between the councils or boards of directors and international organizations or institutions or foreign governments, the Executive Power shall specify those cases that will require its prior approval, without prejudice to the powers pertaining to the Legislative Power, as established by Section V. Art. 186. The services of Posts and Telegraph, Customs and Ports Administrations, and Public Health may not be decentralized in the form of autonomous entities, although the law may grant them a degree of autonomy compatible with control by the Executive Power. Art. 187. Members of boards of directors and directors general who are not elective shall be appointed by the President of the Republic in accord with the Council of Ministers, with the prior consent of the Senate, granted on the basis of a proposal indicating the personal, functional, and technical qualifications, by a number of votes equal to three fifths of the members elected as prescribed by Article 94, section 1. If the consent is not given within sixty days after receipt of the request, the Executive Power may make a new proposal or repeat his former request, and in the latter case he must obtain an affirmative vote of an absolute majority of the members of the Senate. By a three-fifths vote of the full membership of each chamber, a law may establish some other system of appointment. Art. 188. A three-fifths vote of the full membership of each chamber shall be required for a law to allow the admission of private capital in the organization or expansion of the assets of autonomous entities or decentralized services, as well as to regulate the participation in such cases that may pertain to shareholders on boards of directors.

The contribution of private capital and its representation on councils or boards of directors shall never be greater than that of the State. The State may, likewise, participate in the industrial, agricultural, or commercial activities of enterprises formed by working men's contributions, co-operatives, or private capital, if it has the free consent of the enterprise and conditions are previously agreed upon between the parties. By an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber a law may authorize such participation in each case, ensuring participation of the State in the direction of the enterprise. Its representatives shall be governed by the same rules as are the directors of autonomous entities and decentralized services. Art. 189. A two-thirds vote of the full membership of each chamber shall be required to create new autonomous entities and to dissolve those in existence. Art. 190. The autonomous entities and decentralized services may not conduct any business foreign to that specifically assigned to them by law, nor may they devote any of their resources to purposes foreign to their normal activities. Art. 191. The autonomous entities, decentralized services, and in general all autonomous administrative agencies with their own assets, regardless of their juridical nature, shall publish periodic statements which shall clearly show their financial condition. The law shall specify the content and yearly number thereof and each shall be countersigned by the Tribunal of Accounts. Art. 192. The members of boards of directors or directors general shall terminate their positions whenever, in accordance with pertinent rules, their successors have been appointed or elected. Permanent vacancies shall be filled by the procedure established for the initial filling of the respective positions, but the law may provide that alternates may be elected jointly with elected principals and replace the latter in the event of a temporary or permanent vacancy. A law, enacted by an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber, shall regulate the procedure governing temporary vacancies, without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding paragraph. Persons may be reelected or appointed to another board of directors or as another director general provided their conduct has not been subject to objection by the Tribunal of Accounts by a vote of at least four of its members. Art. 193. The outgoing councils or boards of directors must submit an accounting of their work to the Executive Power, after report by the Tribunal of Accounts, without prejudice to liabilities incurred, in accordance with the provisions of Section XII. Art. 194. The final decisions of the autonomous entities may only be appealed or reviewed before the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal or


1255

the Judicial Power, as provided in this Constitution or the laws, without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 197 and 198. Art. 195. A Social Welfare Bank is created, as an autonomous entity, charged with co-ordinating state social welfare services and organizing social security, pursuant to the rules to be established by a law which must be enacted within a period of one year. Its directors may not be candidates for any elective office until one governmental term has elapsed following their termination, the provisions of Article 201, third paragraph, being applicable in this case. Art. 196. There shall be a Central Bank of the Republic, which shall be organized as an autonomous entity, and it shall have the powers and duties specified in a law approved by an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber. Art. 197. Whenever the Executive Power considers any act of the boards of directors or directors general to be inappropriate or illegal, he may make such objections as are deemed pertinent and he may order the suspension of acts to which he has objected. Should these objections be disregarded, the Executive Power may order such ratifications, corrections, or removals as the case may demand, communicating this to the Senate, which shall render a final decision. Where pertinent, the provisions of the second and third paragraphs of Article 198 shall apply. Art. 198. The provisions of the preceding article shall not affect the authority of the Executive Power to remove members of boards of directors or directors general, with the approval of the Senate, in cases of inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance in the exercise of their functions or for the commission of acts which affect their reputation or the prestige of the institution with which they are connected. If the Senate does not act within a period of sixty days, the Executive Power may effect the removal. Whenever he deems it necessary, the Executive Power, acting in Council of Ministers, may replace members of boards of directors or directors general, the removal of whom he had requested approval, by members of boards of directors general of other entities, as interim appointments until the Senate has acted. The dismissals and removals provided for in this and the preceding article shall not give right to any appeal before the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal. Art. 199. Amendment to the organic charter of the State banks require an absolute majority of the votes of the full membership of each chamber. Art. 200. Members of the boards of directors or directors general of the autonomous entities or the decentralized services may not be appointed to posts, not even to honorary posts, which are directly or indirectly connected with the institution to which they belong. This provision does not include council members or directors of educational services, who may be reelected as teachers or professors and appointed to the post of dean or to honorary teaching positions. This inhibition shall be effective for a period of one year following the termination of the functions on which it is based, whatever may be the reason for such termination, and shall include any other post, professional or otherwise, even though not permanent in character nor with fixed remuneration. Nor may members of boards of directors or directors general of the autonomous entities or decentralized services simultaneously practice professions or engage in activities which directly or indirectly bear relation to the institution with which they are connected. The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs are not applicable to teachers. Art. 201. In order to become candidates as legislators, members of boards of directors or directors general of the autonomous entities and the decentralized services must terminate their position at least twelve months prior to the date of the election. In such cases, the mere presentation of a resignation based on these grounds shall effect an immediate termination of office. Electoral organizations shall not certify lists which include candidates who have not complied with this requirement.
CHAPTER II

Art. 202. Higher, secondary, primary, normal, industrial and artistic public education shall be governed by one or more autonomous councils of directors. Other State teaching services shall also be entrusted to autonomous councils of directors if the law so provides by a two-thirds vote of the full membership of each chamber. The public education entities shall be consulted by the parliamentary committees for advisory purposes, in the drafting of laws relating to their services. Each chamber may fix a time for such consultations. The law shall provide for the co-ordination of education. Art. 203. The councils of directors for teaching services shall be appointed or elected in such manner as may be provided by law by an absolute majority of votes of the full membership of each chamber. The Council of Directors of the University of the Republic shall be appointed by the organs of which it is composed, and the councils of these organs shall be elected by teachers, students, and alumni, in accordance with provisions of a law to be passed by the majority indicated in the preceding paragraph.

Art. 204. The councils of directors shall have such powers and duties as may be determined by a law approved by an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber. These councils shall establish statutes for their officials in conformity with the bases provided in Articles 58 and 61 and such fundamental rules as the law may provide, taking into consideration the special features of the entity. Art. 205. Articles 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 198 (paragraphs 1 and 2), 200, and 201 shall be applicable, wherever pertinent, to the various educational services. SECTION XII THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL

The law shall specify the form of organization and the functions thereof. Art. 207. The National Economic Council shall communicate with the public powers in writing but it may argue its points of view before the legislative committees, through one or more of its members.

SECTION XIII THE TRIBUNAL OF ACCOUNTS
CHAPTER I

Art. 208. The Tribunal of Accounts shall be composed of seven members, who must meet the same qualifications as those required of a Senator. They shall be appointed by the General Assembly by a two-thirds vote of its full membership. The prohibitions contained in Articles 122, 123, 124, and 125 shall apply in this respect. The terms of members shall end when the General Assembly which replaces the one that appointed them makes appointments for the new period. They may be reelected, and for each member there shall be three alternates for cases of vacancy, temporary disability or leave of absence.


Art. 209. The members of the Tribunal of Accounts are responsible to the General Assembly, in joint session, for the faithful and accurate fulfilment of their functions. The General Assembly may remove them in case of inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance, by a two-thirds vote of its full membership. Art. 210. The Tribunal of Accounts shall have functional autonomy, which shall be regulated by a law to be drafted by the Tribunal itself. The law may also give it other functions not specified in this Section. Art. 211. It shall be the province of the Tribunal of Accounts: (a) To deliver opinions and furnish information on budget matters; (b) To supervise expenditures and payments, in accordance with the rules and regulations to be established by law, for the sole purpose of certifying as to their legality, appending whenever necessary any pertinent objections. Should the respective auditor persist, he shall communicate the matter to the Tribunal, without prejudice to compliance with the order. Should the Tribunal of Accounts in turn maintain its objections, it shall communicate detailed information to the General Assembly, or to whoever may be acting in its stead, for appropriate action. In the departmental governments, autonomous entities and decentralized services, the duties to which this paragraph refers may be performed under like conditions through the intermediary of the respective accountants or officials acting in their stead, who shall perform such duties under the supervision of the Tribunal of Accounts, subject to the provisions of law, which may extend this rule to other public services administering funds; (c) To deliver opinions and furnish information with respect to the submission of accounts and activities of all the organs of the State, including departmental governments, autonomous entities and decentralized services, regardless of their nature, as well as, insofar as appropriate action in cases of responsibility is concerned, setting forth the pertinent considerations and objections; (d) To present to the General Assembly an annual report relative to the rendering of accounts required under the preceding paragraph; (e) To intervene in all matters relating to the financial activities of the organs of the State, the departmental governments, autonomous entities and decentralized services, and to report to the appropriate authority all irregularities in the management of public funds or infractions of budgetary and accounting laws; (f) To issue ordinances on accounting which shall be binding on all organs of the State, departmental governments, autonomous entities and decentralized services, regardless of their nature; (g) To draft its budget, which it shall submit to the Executive Power to be included in the general budget. The Executive Power, with such modifications as it may see fit to make, shall transmit it to the Legislative Power for final action. Art. 212. The Tribunal of Accounts shall exercise supervision in all matters within its competence and, subject to the provisions of its organic law, over all offices of accounts, collections and payments of the State, departmental governments, autonomous entities and decentralized services, regardless of their nature, and it may propose to appropriate officials such changes as it may consider advisable. Art. 213. The Tribunal of Accounts shall present to the Executive Power the draft of a law on accounting and financial administration, and the Executive Power shall submit it to the Legislative Power with such suggestions as it may deem appropriate. Such draft shall include regulatory provisions covering financial and economic administration, and particularly the organization of the accounting and collection services; the requisites, for purposes of supervision, for the acquisition and alienation of property and the making of contracts affecting the public wealth and for making effective preventive supervision of receipts, expenditures and payments; and the responsibilities and guaranties which shall be exacted from officials who have to do with the handling of the patrimony of the State.

he may propose any changes deemed indispensable in the total amount of expenditures, investments, and salaries or revenues and may create new items, and make deletions and modifications, in programs for duly justifiable reasons. Art. 215. The Legislative Power exclusively shall pass upon the overall amount of each item, program, the objective thereof, wage scales and number of officials, and revenues, but it may not make changes that will mean greater expenditures than those proposed. Art. 216. A special section in the budgets may be established by law which shall comprise the ordinary permanent expenditures of the administration, for which a periodic revision is not necessary. Items shall not be included in the budgets when they cover a period longer than the term of office of the government or which do not refer exclusively to its interpretation or execution. All budgetary drafts shall be transmitted to the appropriate official for consideration and approval, including a comparison with the current budgets.
CHAPTER II

Art. 217. Each chamber must pass upon the draft budgets or laws governing rendition of accounts within forty-five days after they are received.

The budgets of the industrial or commercial entities of the State shall be drafted by each of these and submitted to the Executive Power and to the Tribunal of Accounts five months before the beginning of each fiscal period, with the exception of the period following an election year, when it may be submitted at any time. The Tribunal of Accounts shall report thereon within thirty days after receipt. The Executive Power, with the advice of the Office of Planning and Budget, may make objections, and in such case, as well as when the Tribunal of Accounts offers objections, the budget is returned to the respective entity. If the entity accepts the objections of the Executive Power and the report of the Tribunal of Accounts, the modified drafts are returned to the Executive Power for approval of the budget, and their inclusion in the national budget for informational purposes. If the agreement called for in the foregoing paragraph is not attained, the draft budgets shall be transmitted to the General Assembly, with the added information. The General Assembly, in joint session, shall settle the differences, subject to the provisions of Article 215, by a two-thirds vote of its full membership. If no decision is reached within forty days, the budget with the objections of the Executive Power shall be considered adopted. The report of the Tribunal of Accounts requires an affirmative vote of the majority of its members.

Art. 224. The departmental boards shall consider the draft budgets prepared by the intendentes within four months after they are submitted. Art. 225. The departmental boards may modify the draft budgets only to increase revenues or decrease expenditures and may not give approval to any draft which indicates a deficit, and they may not create positions on their own initiative. Prior to approval of the budget, the board shall request reports from the Tribunal of Accounts, which shall act within twenty days, and may offer objections only as to errors in the calculation of revenues, the omission of budgetary obligations, or the violation of applicable constitutional or legal provisions.

If the board accepts the objections of the Tribunal of Accounts, or does not dispute them, the budget is definitively approved. In any case the board may not make other changes subsequent to the report submitted by the Tribunal of Accounts. If the departmental board does not accept the objections offered by the Tribunal of Accounts, the budget and statement of facts of the case shall be submitted to the General Assembly which, meeting in joint session, shall pass on the discrepancies within a period of forty days, and if no decision is reached, the budget shall be considered approved. Art. 226. Upon expiration of the period described in Article 224, if the departmental board has not taken final action, the draft budget submitted by the intendente shall be considered to be rejected.

CHAPTER V

Art. 228. Supervision of the execution of the budgets and the exercise of control in all matters relating to the public wealth shall be vested in the Tribunal of Accounts. As long as a draft budget has not been approved, the previous budget shall continue to be in effect. Art. 229. The Legislative Power, the departmental boards, the autonomous entities and decentralized services may not approve budgets, create offices, make increases in salaries and retirement allowances, or approve increases in items for wages or contracted services, within twelve months prior to the date of the regular elections, with the exception of the allotments referred to in Articles 117, 154, and 295.

Simultaneously with an intendente four alternates shall be elected, who may be called upon in their order of election to perform the duties in the event of a vacancy in the post, a temporary impediment, or leave of absence of the principal. Non-acceptance of the post by an alternate shall mean the loss of his status as such, unless the call was to fill a temporary vacancy. If the post of intendente becomes permanently vacant and the list of alternates is exhausted, the departmental board shall elect a new principal by an absolute majority of its membership and for the remaining period of the current term. In the interim, or if the vacancy is temporary, the post shall be held by the president of the departmental board-provided he meets the provisions of Articles 266 and 267-and in his default, by the vice-president if he meets the qualifications.

The positions of members of the departmental boards shall be distributed among the various parties in proportion to the number of votes of each, without prejudice to the provisions of the succeeding paragraphs. If the party that won the office of intendente received only a plurality of votes that party shall be allotted the majority of seats on the departmental board, distributed proportionally among all its lists. The remaining seats are to be distributed according to the system of integral proportional representation among those parties which did not obtain representation under the previous allotment.

CHAPTER VI

Art. 281. Decrees adopted by the departmental board, to be effective, must first be promulgated by the intendente. The latter may object to those deemed unsuitable, but the board may sustain its position by a three-fifths vote of its full membership, and in such case the decree will take effect immediately. If the intendente does not return a decree within ten days after receipt, it shall be considered promulgated and is to be enforced as such. Objections may not be made to budgets which have gone to the General Assembly by the procedure provided in Aerticl 225. Art. 282.

In any community beyond the city limits of the capital of a department there may be a local board whose members shall be appointed, insofar as possible, on the basis of the proportional representation of parties on the departmental board. There shall be five members, who shall have the same qualifications as are required for members of the departmental board and who must be residents of the locality for at least three years, or a native thereof, and the intendente or members of the departmental board may not be named to it. Its president shall represent the local board and carry out its resolutions. Art. 288. The law shall prescribe the conditions for the creation of the local boards and their powers, and by an absolute majority of votes of the full membership of each chamber and at the initiative of the respective departmental government may broaden their scope of action in communities which though not the capital of a department have over ten thousand inhabitants or are of special national interest for the development of tourist travel. The law may also, by meeting the same requirements, provide that the members of these autonomous local boards shall be elected by the people.
CHAPTER VIII

Art. 289.

Art. 292. Violation of the provisions of the preceding articles shall result in immediate dismissal from office. Art. 293. The position of member of a departmental board or local board is incompatible with that of intendente, but this provision shall not
apply to members of departmental boards who are called upon to hold the position of intendente temporarily. In this event, their functions as members of the departmental board will be suspended and the position occupied, during the suspension, by their alternates. Art. 294. The offices of intendente and member of a departmental board are incompatible with the exercise of any other elective public office, regardless of its nature.

Art. 297. The sources of revenues of the departmental governments, decreed and administered by them, shall be the following: (1) Taxes on urban and suburban real property, located within their jurisdiction, excepting in all cases the national supplementary taxes (adicionales), in existence or subsequently imposed. Taxes on rural real property will be levied by the Legislative Power, but their collection and all proceeds, except from the supplementary taxes in existence or subsequently imposed, shall go to the departmental governments.

Excepted therefrom are press and radio advertising as well as political, religious, trade union, cultural and sports advertising and any others that the law may exempt by an absolute majority of the full membership of each chamber; (8) Profits obtained from games of chance already authorized or subsequently authorized by law, in such form and under the conditions established therein; (9) Taxes on horse racing and other competitive sports in which pari mutuel betting is used, with the exception of those exempted by law until it is repealed; (10) Proceeds from fines; (a) as established by the departmental government, until repealed or that may be established under its powers; (b) as established by laws in effect, for the benefit of the departmental governments; (c) that may be established by new laws, for the benefit of the departmental governments. (11) Income from property owned by the departmental government and the proceeds from sales thereof; (12) Gifts, inheritances and legacies made to it and accepted; (18) The share in the percentage of the total revenues of the national budget specified in the budgetary law to be allotted to the departmental public works.

Art. 299. The decrees of the departmental governments creating or changing taxes shall not be enforced until ten days after publication in the Diario Oficial and they shall be published in a special section of the Register of Laws and Decrees (Registro Nacional de Leyes y Decretos). They must also be published in at least two newspapers in the department. Art. 300. The Executive Power, within fifteen days following their publication in the Diario Oficial, may appeal to the Chamber of Representatives against decrees of the departmental governments which create or change taxes, on grounds of the public interest. Such appeal is suspensive in effect. If no action is taken on the appeal in the Chamber of Representatives, within sixty days after receipt, the appeal is considered void. Within fifteen days after an appeal has been submitted to the Chamber of Representatives, it may request, once only, any necessary supplementary information, and the sixty-day period is interrupted until this is received. A recess of the Chamber of Representatives interrupts any of the periods mentioned in the foregoing. Art. 301. The departmental governments may not issue certificates of departmental public debt, nor borrow money or contract loans from international organizations or foreign institutions or governments, except at the instance of the intendente, approved by the departmental board, based on a report by the Tribunal of Accounts, and with the approval of the Legislative Power by an absolute majority of the full membership of the General Assembly in joint session, within a period of sixty days, upon the expiration of which the approval shall be considered granted. Contracts for any other type of loan shall require the initiative of the intendente and approval by an absolute majority of votes of the full membership of the departmental board, following a report by the Tribunal of Accounts. If the period of the loan is to exceed the term of office of the intendente who proposed it, a two-thirds vote of the full membership of the departmental board is required. Art. 302. Any surplus must be applied in full to special amortizations of departmental obligations. If there are no obligations, it shall be used for the execution of public works or for remunerative investments through the adoption of a resolution by the departmental board, proposed by the intendente and following a report by the Tribunal of Accounts.
CHAPTER XI

Art. 303. Decrees of the departmental board and resolutions of the intendente which are contrary to the Constitution or the laws, not susceptible of being taken before the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, shall be appealable to the Chamber of Representatives within fifteen days after their promulgation, by one third of the members of a departmental board or by one thousand citizens registered in the department. In the latter case, and when the decree appealed is for the purpose of increasing departmental revenues, the appeal shall not have suspensive effect. If within sixty days following receipt of the facts by the Chamber of Representatives, the appeal is not acted upon by a joint session, the appeal shall be considered as not having been taken. The Chamber of Representatives, within fifteen days after it has been notified of the appeal, may request, once only, any desired supplementary information, and the period for action is interrupted until this has been received. A recess of the Chamber of Representatives interrupts the foregoing periods.

Art. 304. The law, by an absolute majority of votes of the full membership of each chamber, may introduce the referendum as a recourse against decrees of the departmental boards. Likewise, by an absolute majority of the votes of the full membership of each chamber, the law may introduce and regulate the right of popular initiative in affairs of the departmental government. Art. 305. Fifteen percent of the registered residents of a locality or district specified by law shall have the right of initiative before the organs of the departmental government in matters affecting that jurisdiction. Art. 306. The police force shall lend its co-operation to the departmental boards and intendentes and to the local boards, whenever this is required for the fulfilment of their functions.

SECTION XVII THE CONTENTIOUS-ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL
CHAPTER I

Art. 307. There shall be a Contentious-Administrative Tribunal which shall be composed of five members. In cases of vacancy and as long as these are not filled, and in the event of challenge, excuse, or disability to fulfil the jurisdictional function, the places shall be filled in such manner as may be prescribed by law. Art. 308. The qualifications necessary for members of this Tribunal, the manner of their appointment, the prohibitions and incompatibilities, their remuneration and term of office shall be those established for members of the Supreme Court of Justice.
CHAPTER II

Art. 309. The Contentious-Administrative Tribunal shall hear pleas for the nullification of definitive administrative acts performed by the government in the exercise of its functions which are contrary to a rule of law or which are a distortion of authority. The Tribunal shall also have jurisdiction over definitive administrative acts of the departmental governments, the autonomous entities, and the decentralized services. Action for nullification may be taken only by one who has a right or a direct, personal and legitimate interest which is violated or injured by the administrative act.

1278

Uruguay

Art. 310. The Tribunal shall limit itself to appraising the act in itself, confirming or annulling it, without alteration. In issuing a decision all members of the Tribunal must concur, but a simple majority is sufficient to declare the annulment of an act contested on grounds of injury to a subjective right. In other cases, annulment of an act shall require four favorable votes. However, the Tribunal shall reserve to the complaining party the right to sue for redress if three favorable votes declare the grounds for annulment sufficiently justified. Art. 311. Whenever the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal declares the annulment of an administrative act contested on grounds of injury to a subjective right of the plaintiff, the decision shall have effect solely in the case acted upon. If the decision declares the annulment of an act with respect to a rule of law or of good administration, it shall have general and absolute effect. Art. 312. When annulment has been declared or the right of action for redress reserved, as the case may be, the claim for redress must be entered in the ordinary courts to determine the damages incurred. The law, by a three-fifths vote of the full membership of each chamber, may broaden the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by giving it the right to hear claims for redress. Art. 313. The Tribunal shall, in addition, act upon conflicts of jurisdiction, based upon legislation and upon the differences that may arise between the Executive Power, the departmental governments, the autonomous entities and the decentralized services, and likewise upon disputes or differences arising between one and another of these organs. It shall act also upon disputes or differences that may arise among the members of the departmental boards, the directorates or councils of the autonomous entities and decentralized services, provided they have not been settled by the normal procedure for ascertaining the will of the agency concerned. All disputes based on the Constitution shall be heard by the Supreme Court of Justice.
CHAPTER III

Art. 314. There shall be a State Attorney in the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, appointed by the Executive Power. The qualifications necessary for this position, the prohibitions and incompatibilities, as well as its remuneration and term of office, shall be determined by the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal. Art. 315. The State Attorney in the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal shall necessarily be heard at the final hearing on all matters within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.


The State Attorney is independent in the exercise of his functions. Consequently he may render opinions according to his convictions based upon what he believes to be the intent of the law. Art. 316. The defendant official may have such representation or counsel as he may consider necessary.
CHAPTER IV

Art. 317. Administrative acts may be contested by a plea for reversal, before the same official who issued the orders, within a period of ten days counted from the day following personal notification, if such was the case, or following publication in the Diario Oficial. If the administrative act was executed by an official subject to higher authority, it may also be contested by a plea to that authority, who shall become jointly and subsidiarily a party to the plea for reversal. If the administrative act comes from an authority which under its juridical statutes is subject to administrative supervision, it may be contested on the same grounds for annulment as provided in Article 309, by a petition for annulment before the Executive Power, which must become a party jointly and subsidiarily to the plea for reversal. If the act issues from an organ of the departmental governments it may be contested by a plea for retrial and appeal in the manner provided by law. Art. 318. Every administrative authority is required to act upon any petition submitted by a person having a legitimate interest in the execution of a specific administrative act and to act upon any administrative pleas against his decisions, after taking such steps as may be necessary for due understanding of the matter, within a period of twenty days from the date of enforcement of the last act imposed by law or by applicable regulation. The petition is considered denied or the plea rejected if the authority in question does not act within the indicated time limit. Art. 319. Action for annulment before the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal may not be taken if appropriate previous remedies in administrative channels have not been exhausted. Action for annulment must be taken, under penalty of forfeiture, within the period prescribed by law in each case.
CHAPTER V

Art. 320. The law may, by a three-fifths vote of the full membership of each chamber, create subordinate organs within the contentious-administrative jurisdiction. These organs shall be appointed by the Contentious-Administrative Tribunal, in accordance with whatever the law may prescribe on the basis of provisions covering the Judicial Power, and they shall be subject to its directive, disciplinary, advisory and economic supervision. Art. 321. The Contentious-Administrative Tribunal shall prepare its budgets and transmit them in due course to the Executive Power for inclusion in the draft general budget with such modifications as may be deemed pertinent. SECTION XVIII ELECTORAL JUSTICE
CHAPTER I

Art. 322. There shall be an Electoral Court which shall have the following powers in addition to those established in Section III or which may be prescribed by law: (a) To act in all matters relating to electoral acts or procedures; (b) To exercise directive, disciplinary, advisory, and economic supervision over electoral organs; (c) To render final decision on all appeals and claims that may arise and act as judge of the elections to all elective offices, and of plebiscites and referendums. Art. 323. In budgetary and financial matters, the provisions of Section XIV shall apply. Art. 324. The Electoral Court shall be composed of nine members and twice as many alternates. Five members and their alternates shall be appointed by the General Assembly in joint session by a two-thirds vote of its full membership, and they must be citizens who by virtue of their position in the political scene afford a guarantee of impartiality. The four remaining members, representatives of the parties, shall be elected by the General Assembly by the system of the double simultaneous vote, two to be selected from the majority list of the party having the most votes and two from the majority list of the party with the next highest number of votes. Art. 325. The members of the Electoral Court may not be candidates for any office requiring election by the people, unless they resign and terminate their functions at least six months before the date of the election. Art. 326. The resolutions of the Electoral Court shall be adopted by a majority vote and to be valid must have the affirmative vote of at least three of the five members to which paragraph 1 of Article 324 refers, unless they are adopted by a two-thirds vote of the full membership. Art. 327. The Electoral Court may annul the elections in whole or in part, this step requiring an affirmative vote of six members, three of
whom must be members elected by the two-thirds vote of the General Assembly. In such event it must call for a new election-in whole or in part which shall take place on the second Sunday following the date of nullification. Art. 328. The Electoral Court shall communicate directly with the public powers. SECTION XIX THE OBSERVANCE OF FORMER LAWS. ENFORCEMENT AND AMENDMENT OF THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION
CHAPTER I

Art. 329. There are hereby declared to be in full force and effect the laws which up to the present time have governed in all matters and points which are not directly in conflict with this Constitution or with the laws issued by the Legislative Power.
CHAPTER II

Art. 330. Any person who attacks or who is instrumental in attacking the present Constitution, following its sanction and publication, shall be regarded, tried, and punished as guilty of treason.
CHAPTER III

Art. 331. The present Constitution may be amended, in whole or in part, in accordance with the following procedures: (a) Upon the initiative of ten percent of the citizens inscribed in the National Civil Register, by presenting a detailed proposal which shall be referred to the President of the General Assembly, to be submitted for popular decision at the next election. The General Assembly, meeting in joint session, may take substitute proposals which shall be submitted to plebiscitary decision together with the popular initiative. (b) By proposal of amendment approved by two fifths of the full membership of the General Assembly, presented to the President thereof, and submitted to plebiscite at the next ensuing election. For an affirmative result in the methods outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b), a "yes" vote of an absolute majority of the citizens participating in the elections shall be required, and this majority must represent at least
thirty-five percent of all persons inscribed in the National Civil Register. (c) The Senators, Representatives, and the Executive Power may present proposed amendments which must be approved by an absolute majority of the full membership of the General Assembly. A proposal which is rejected may not be renewed until the succeeding legislative period, and the same formalities must be observed. Upon the approval of a proposal and its promulgation by the President of the General Assembly, the Executive Power, within ninety days thereafter, shall call for the election of a National Constituent Convention, which shall consider and decide upon approved proposals for amendment as well as upon any other proposals that may be presented to the Convention. The number of members of the Convention shall be double the number of legislators. Twice as many alternates shall be elected at the same time. The conditions for eligibility and the immunities and incompatibilities shall be the same as for representatives. The election by departmental lists shall be governed by the system of integral proportional representation and in accordance with laws in force for the election of representatives. The Convention shall meet within one year from the date of promulgation of the proposal of amendment. The decisions of the Convention must be taken by an absolute majority of the whole number of members of the Convention and the work of the Convention must be terminated within one year from the date of its commencement. The proposal or proposals drawn up by the Convention shall be communicated to the Executive Power for immediate and full publication. The proposal or proposals drawn up by the Convention must be ratified by the electoral body convoked for the purpose by the Executive Power, on the date to be fixed by the National Constituent Convention. Voting shall be by "yes" or "no" and if there are several texts of amendment, it shall be separate for each of them. For this purpose the Constituent Convention shall group together those amendments which by their nature require that they be voted on as a unit. One third of the members of the Convention may require separate voting on one or several texts. An amendment or amendments must be approved by a majority of votes, which shall not be less than thirty-five percent of the citizens inscribed in the National Civil Register. In the cases contemplated by paragraphs (a) and (b), there shall be submitted for ratification by plebiscite at the same time as the next elections only those proposals which have been presented at least six months before the date of such elections, or in the first of these cases, three months before, for substitute proposals approved by the General Assembly. Proposals presented after the periods mentioned shall be submitted to plebiscite at the time of the subsequent elections. (d) The Constitution may be amended, also, by constitutional laws which
