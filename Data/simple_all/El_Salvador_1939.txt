E L SALVADOR PART I.—THE NATION AND FORM OF GOVERNMENT

EL SALVADOR

677

ART. 1. Salvador is a free, sovereign and independent nation. Its form of government is republican, democratic and representative. It aspires to form, with the other nations of the continent, a compact democracy in America. Sovereignty is inalienable and imprescriptible and limited to what is honest, just and beneficial to society. It lies essentially in Salvadoreans as a whole, and no section of nation or individuals may usurp it. 2. All public power emanates from the people. The officials of the state are their delegates, and they have no powers other than those which the law specifically gives to them. 3. The government of Salvador is composed of three powers, distinct and independent each from the other, which are called: legislative, executive and judicial. 4. The boundaries of Salvador shall be determined by law, and based on those which have been traditionally and historically recognised. 5. None of the constituted powers may conclude or approve treaties or conventions in which the established form of government is modified in any way, or the national integrity impaired ; this being understood without prejudice to the provisions of the following article. 6. Salvador, being a disjoined part of the former republic of Central America, continues to be capable of union with all or any of the states thereof in the organisation of a national government when circumstances permit and it accords with its interests to do so.

(3) The descendants of sons of foreigners, born in Salvador, who shall not have opted for the nationality of their parents.

(4) The children of Central Americans by birth, born in the republic. 9. Salvadoreans by naturalisation are those persons who, in conformity with previous laws, have acquired this status and who may in future acquire it in accordance with the following rules: (1) Central Americans by birth, of good conduct, who manifest before the competent authority the desire to be Salvadoreans. (2) Spaniards and Spanish-Americans by birth who obtain naturalisation from the competent authorities, which will grant it upon proof of the applicant's good conduct and of 3 years' residence in the country. (3) Foreigners of whatever other origin who obtain a letter of naturalisation, also from the competent authority, proving their good conduct, 6 years' residence in the country, and having a profession, office or other honest means of livelihood.

(5) The children of foreigners, born in Salvador, who within the year following their majority state to the competent authority that they opt for Salvadorean nationality, and prove their good conduct. (6) A foreign woman who marries a Salvadorean, unless at the time of contracting marriage she declares her desire to retain her nationality of origin. The authority before which the declaration referred to in rules (1), (2) and (5) of this article must be made is the executive power in the Department of Internal Affairs ; this same authority shall issue the letter of naturalisation in the case of rule (3). The law shall establish the necessary procedure. 10. A Salvadorean woman who contracts marriage with a foreigner shall retain her nationality, unless she opts for that of her husband. A Salvadorean woman by birth who upon marriage changes her nationality for that of her husband may recover it on the dissolution of the marriage. 11.

Salvador recognises rights and duties anterior and superior to the positive laws, having as principles liberty,

equality and fraternity and as basis the family, work, property and public order.

The ratification published in the Official Gazette terminates the legal suspension of an act, so long as the observations of the court of accounts do not establish a lack or insufficiency of budgetary credit from which to meet expenditure ; in such case the suspension ends only when the shortage of funds has been remedied. 159. The Court of Accounts shall be formed by a superior chamber and inferior ones established by law. The superior chamber will be composed of a president and two judges. In addition there will be such substitutes as the law may determine.

The titular members as well as the substitutes will be elected by the national assembly for a period of 4 years, being eligible for re-election ; and they may be removed only for a just reason by a decision of the assembly. The judges of the inferior chambers will be appointed by the superior chamber. Other employees of the Court of Accounts will be appointed by its president. The organisation and operation of the Court of Accounts will be the subject of a special law but in every case duties of an administrative character will appertain to the president of the court, who may delegate them to the other judges. 160. The president and the judges of the Court of Accounts must be Salvadoreans by birth, in full exercise of their civil rights, over 30 years of age and having the necessary ability and good repute. 161. The president of the Court of Accounts will render a detailed and documented report of its work annually to the national assembly. 162. When the state or the municipalities have to enter into contracts in which national or municipal revenues or assets are involved the proposal must be published in the Official Gazette and offered to public tender ; except as defined by law. In no case shall contracts be entered into in which judgment, ill. the event of dispute is within the competence of a foreign court; and in interpretation the Spanish text shall always prevail. 163. In any concession granted or contract entered into by the state for the building of piers, railways and canals or any other work of public utility it shall be stipulated that such works, shall after a certain time, which may not exceed 50 years, pass in perfect working order to the state without indemnity whatsoever. 164. Neither the legislative power nor the executive may distribute the amounts allotted to officials and employees who handle national or communal funds, or debts in favour of the exchequer or of the municipalities. 165.. Credit institutions are exempt from the technico-legal supervision of the Court of Accounts of the republic, to which section 4 of article 158 refers ; and the other bodies to which the same section refers will not be subject to preventive measures, but only to the annual examination of their accounts, unless the law determines otherwise, in case of need.

EL SALVADOR PART XIII.—THE NATIONAL ARMY

E L SALVADOR

711

166. The national army is an institution for the maintenance of the integrity of Salvadorean territory, to preserve and defend national autonomy, to fulfil the law, maintain public order and to ensure the efficacy of constitutional guarantees. 167. The armed force is essentially subject to discipline and may not deliberate or exercise the right of petition if it is not in accordance with the law. 168. Troops on the active list have no right of suffrage, nor may they obtain offices by popular election, except as President of the Republic. 169. Military service is obligatory for all Salvadoreans from the age of 18 to 50 years. In case of war, when that class is exhausted, all Salvadoreans capable of bearing arms are soldiers. . In time of peace, for garrison duty, only Salvadoreans between 18 and 25 years of age may be called up. 170. The national army is composed of the arms and services which the respective constituent law requires. The selection of individuals who must serve in the army in time of peace must be made by drawing lots in accordance with the law.. The permanent force in time of peace shall be fixed annually by the National Assembly and limited to what is necessary for compliance with article 77. 171. Those who enter into the active ranks of the army shall, at the time stipulated by law, take the oath of loyalty to the national flag and to the constitution. 172. Military rank shall be acquired and retained personally, it is untransferable and for life, and cannot be taken away except by judicial sentence. Promotions will be made strictly from rank to rank and to fill the vacancies as they occur. A law will govern promotions, retirements and pensions of members of the army. 173. Court-martial is established for military offences. In judgments by court-martial, which the military laws establish, the selection of members shall in every case be mad© by casting lots among the commanders and officers eligible according to law.

174. The Commander-in-Chief of the army will be the supreme chief of the armed forces and will have the following powers : - • • ' • ' ' (a) To deal in final instance with the decisions of courtsmartial ; (b) To deal with the remedies which the law establishes as to what has been decided in petitions of members of the army ; and (c) To exercise the supreme command of the army or to delegate it in case of war, and such other powers which military laws and orders confer upon him. 175. The field commander concerned shall also, in his turn, deal with the decisions of the courts-martial, in accordance with the law.
PART XIV.—RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS

176. Every civil or military official, before taking possession of his office, shall swear on his word of honour to be loyal to the Republic, to carry out and cause others to carry out the constitution, adhering to its text, whatever the laws, decrees, orders or resolutions which contravene it may be, promising moreover, the exact fulfilment of the duties which the post may impose upon him, for the breach of which he shall be responsible according to law. 177. The President of the Republic, or whoever exercises his powers, the President and Judges of the Supreme Court of Justice, ministers and under-secretaries of state, the President and Judges of the Court of Accounts of the Republic and diplomatic ministers shall be answerable to the National Assembly for official and civil offences which they may commit. The Assembly, upon hearing a prosecutor who shall be one of themselves and the accused, if he is present, or a special counsel if he is not, will declare if there be a case or not for trial. In the first event the judicial proceedings will be passed to the court of second instance concerned for pronouncement of the sentence, after the relevant judicial process, and in the second they shall be placed in the archives. Appeal against sentence pronounced by the court may be made before the Supreme Court of Justice. Any person has the right to denounce the offences referred to in this article, and to appear as a party if he is qualified to do so by law.

178. As regards deputies, the provisions of article 75 of this constitution shall apply for civil offences and for official offences in accordance with the preceding article. 179. Judges of first instance, departmental governors, justices of the peace, and other officials defined by law will be judged by the civil courts for the official offences they may commit, after the Supreme Court of Justice makes declaration that there is a case for trial. For such petty crimes and offences as the aforesaid employees may commit they will be subject to the usual proceedings. 180. From the time the National Assembly or the Supreme Court of Justice declares that there is a case for trial, the accused shall be suspended from his duties and may not remain at his post for any reason whatever; otherwise he will be guilty of the offence of usurpation of functions. If the verdict be condemnatory, he shall be deprived simultaneously of his employment; but if it be one of acquittal he will return to the performance of his duties, if the employment or office is by nature conferred for a specified term and the period of election or appointment has not expired. 181. Decrees, writs and decisions of the National Assembly, in such cases, must be carried out without the need of confirmation or of sanction whatsoever. 182. When the executive power, in the reports rendered by its ministers to the legislative power, omits details which the law requires to be included or when it does not present the budget and the reports, it shall be required by the National Assembly to fulfil its duty in this respect, and if it does not do so in the time indicated by the National Assembly the minister who fails to comply will by the same act be suspended, which will be notified to the executive immediately so that, in the week following, it may present the aforesaid report and budget through the minister appointed for the purpose. 183. The prescription of official offences and omissions will commence to count from the time that the guilty official vacates his office. 184. Notwithstanding the approval by the legislative power of acts of the executive power, the President, ministers and under-secretaries may be accused for official crimes so long as the term of the prescription shall not have elapsed. The approval of the reports and accounts which the executive power presents to the legislature gives no greater value to

the contracts to which the aforesaid reports or accounts refer than that which they possess in accordance with common law. 185. The representatives of the constituent assemblies are comparable as regards their judgment to the deputies of the legislative assemblies. The procedure in this case will be decided by the constituent assembly, who will appoint a commission from among themselves to draw up the relevant report, proceeding in other matters in accordance with the internal regulations. If the constituent assembly should cease their functions the case shall pass to the legislative assembly for settlement according to established procedure. 186. If at the closure of the legislature the latter have not passed sentence in the cases with which they are dealing, the proceedings will be continued by the legislative assembly the following year. 187. The violation, infraction or modification of constitutional provisions shall be especially penalised by the law; and the acts for which public officials become liable in this respect shall not admit of amnesty during the presidential period within which they are committed.
PART XV.—MODIFICATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND OF THE CONSTITUENT LAWS

188. Modification of this constitution may be made : (1) By a constituent assembly summoned by a plebiscite authorised by at least two-thirds of citizens eligible to vote ; (2) By a constituent assembly which must be convened every 25 years in order to introduce such innovations as experience dictates. The constituent assembly, in this and the preceding case, shall have no limitation of powers ; (3) By two consecutive legislative assemblies ; but in this case the first, with not less than two-thirds o | the votes of the elected deputies, must indicate precisely the article or articles to be abolished or modified, publishing such resolution in the Official Gazette; and the second, with an equal number of votes, if ratifying a decision by the preceding assembly, will decree the changes which, in order to enter into force, must be published in the same official organ. It is enacted that in this manner the articles comprised in Parts I, V, VI, VII, VIII and XII, and in this same Part XV may not be altered in any way, but may be modified only by a constituent assembly.

189. Constituent laws are those of the press, martial law, habeas corpus and electoral matters. The modification of these laws shall be subject to the same formalities prescribed in section 3 of the preceding article. 190. Any method of modification other than those established in the preceding articles is illegal and void. 191. • The number of deputies to the constituent assemblies shall be the same as for deputies to the legislative assemblies ; and the qualifications which they must possess shall be defined in the relevant decree of convocation issued for the purpose by the legislative assembly.
PART XVI.—GENERAL TRANSITORY PROVISIONS

192. The President of the Republic who will be elected by this constituent assembly in accordance with,paragraph 3 of article 91 of this constitution, will not act for a complete term of 6 years, but will hold office for only 5 years and 10 months. The duration of the presidential term, established in the first paragraph of the same article, will be fully effective in the succeeding terms. 193. The new organisation of the judiciary, which is established by this constitution, as well as that of the fiscal ministry, shall have effect as from July 1st of the current year. The judiciary will continue in the meantime as at present organised, while the necessary modifications of the relevant organic law are being decreed, which the Supreme Court of Justice must ^propose to the legislative assembly in their next period of ordinary sessions ; as well as the special bill in which the manner of appointment, conditions, distribution and work of the members of the fiscal ministry shall be defined. The present President of the Supreme Court of Justice and judges of the courts will continue in the exercise of their functions until June 30 of the current year; being considered as elected for the purpose by this constituent assembly for the exercise of their functions during this extension of their term. 194. As the time has elapsed in which the elections of the deputies to the National Legislative Assembly for the current year should have been held and as the hew electoral law has not yet been drawn up, the present National Constituent Assembly will assume the functions of the legislative power during this period, starting their work on February 15 next, the salary of its members and expenses of representation of the

executive committee, as well as the salaries of the employees of the secretariat, being reduced as laid down in section .1, sole chapter, part III of the existing budget law (legislative decree No. 66 of June 30, 1938, published in Official Gazette No. 138 of the same date). The organisation and operation of this assembly, in its legislative character, shall, in the course of its ordinary sessions, ibe subject to the internal regulations decreed on March 13, 1934, where applicable. 195. Pending the drawing up of the organic law to which its organisation and operation must be subject, the Court of Accounts created by this constitution, the Superior Tribunal of Accounts and the office of the Auditor-General of the Republic shall continue their activities in conformity with the laws and regulations at present governing such institutions. The new organic law and the new regulations which will govern the Court of Accounts may be drawn up simultaneously or in sections to facilitate the amalgamation of the Superior Tribunal of Accounts with the office of the Auditor-General of the Republic ; but they must be wholly enacted at the latest during the current year. The President of the Superior Tribunal of Accounts, and the Auditor-General and Sub-Auditor-General of the Republic will continue in their posts until April 15, 1942 ; the present President of the Superior Tribunal of Accounts being held as elected by the National Constituent Assembly to hold his office until that time ; and all these officials being subject, in the exercise of their functions, to the new organic law and regulations for the Court of Accounts to be enacted. 196. The organisation and operation of the municipalities of the republic, in accordance with this constitution, will commence at the end' of the period for which the present corporations have been elected; it being for the National Legislative Assembly to introduce the necessary modifications to this effect in the law of municipal affairs. 197. The existing laws and regulations, in so far as they do not oppose the efficacy of the fundamental principles of this constitution and, until they are abolished or modified, conforming in every detail to the constitution and with each other, will continue to ibe of compulsory application in the republic.
