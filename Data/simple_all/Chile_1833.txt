CHILIL

CONSTITUTION of the Republic of Chili.-Santiago de Chili, the 22nd May, 1833, The President of the Republic to the People.
(Translation.) THE Constitution, as reformed by the Grand Convention, has now been sworn to by all the Magistrates of the Republic ; and upon the occasion of promulgating it, I must be allowed to assure you that I shall be a most rigid observer of all its provisions Myself, and a vigilant enforcer of their due fulfilment by others. It is not for me to enter into an analysis of the reform : my duty is to respect it, and to cause it to be respected. Entrusted, however, as I am with the superintendence of the conduct of your Functionaries, and with the duty of making to you a report thereof, it is with the greatest satisfaction that I can recommend to your gratitude the constancy and zeal with which the Citizens, appointed by the Law for amending our Political Code, have discharged that important service. Your interests have been ever present to them, and their chief object has consequently been to furnish the Government with powers adequate to the circumstances in which the Country finds itself placed. Rejecting theories, as wild as impracticable, they have exclusively devoted their attention to the means of permanently securing public order and tranquillity from the risk of those vicissitudes and changes to which they have been exposed by the violence of faction. Reform is nothing more than the means of putting an end to those convulsions and revolutions originating in the disorganization of the political system in which we were placed by the triumph of independence ; it is the means of rendering National Liberty effective, an advantage which never could have been obtained so long as the powers of Government remained undefined,-so long as no bar was opposed to discord and licentiousness. Fellow Citizens :-If by a pardonable oversight, provisions be not found in this Code, to meet precisely every case which the contingencies and vicissitudes of human affairs may produce, the patriotism of the Nation, and the devoted submission of the Government to the spirit of the Constitutional Law, will remove every obstacle, which might otherwise obstruct its accomplishment. As for Myself, I shall hesitate at no sacrifice in order to cause it to be respected, being convinced that a firm adherence to it will for ever destroy the germs of those political disorders which have hitherto caused your inquietude. As the guardian of your rights, I most solemnly assure you, that I shall fulfil the provisions of the Code just sworn to, with religious scrupulosity, and that I shall enforce the fulfilment of it by others, by every means which the Laws have placed at my disposal, how rigorous soever they may JOAQUIN PRIETO. appear.
FELLOW CITIZENS:

CHI LI.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.
